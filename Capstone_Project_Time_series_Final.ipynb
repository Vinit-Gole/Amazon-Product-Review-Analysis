      "Example 0: Diablo 3 has been fun , but Mac users beware - - while Blizzard says this game is supported for the Mac , any Mac with the Nvidia 9400M video card ( which is many Macbooks , including my 2010 13in Macbook Pro ) will NOT play the game satisfactorily . Even on the lowest graphic settings the game is too sluggish to play ( 5 - 10 FPS ) . At the beginning of the game this lag seems tolerable when there are only a few monsters on the screen , but as you progress into more advanced acts the game slows down to the point where all you do is die to unseen hordes stuttering around the screen . This looks like a fun game , but now I ' ve been forced to buy a new computer or ask for a refund - - it simply cannot play on Macs with Nvidia 9400M cards ! Wait to see if Blizzard fixes this , and the game might be cheaper by then too .\n",

      "Example 0: I am a long - time gamer , but I tend to prefer FPS games with the occasional action RPG ( Skyrim , Witcher 3 ) thrown in . I had long heard of the Diablo franchise but had never waded in . The top down camera angle , and point and click action just wasn ' t my style . Then , when I researched Diablo 3 ' s release last year and all of the fan hate that came with it , I just moved along as I always had . When the most recent patch for Diablo 3 was released , a flurry of positive reviews came out , and coupled with a $ 20 Amazon sale , I gave it a shot . If you have already played Diablo you can stop reading here . If , like me , you have not , keep on reading . Diablo 3 ' s play style is deceptively simple . You mouse click to move , and mouse click to attack . My first thoughts were \" How is this even a game ? \" As you progress , however , you gather new weapons via \" drops \" from slain enemies , and you unlock skills . Many of these skills look pretty good graphically . The enemies also increase in difficulty and number . You soon realize you need to strategize the use and timing of your skills , and try to have your chosen skills complement your chosen weapons . You can play multiple different character classes , basically as a warrior ( Barbarian class in Diablo ) , or a mage , a combination , etc . Over time I found myself sucked into this game to see what cool new loot ( weapons and armor ) I could acquire , and I increased the difficulty to increase the challenge . I am really enjoying the game and I will probably pick up the expansion when I ' m done , assuming I don ' t first replay the game on a higher difficulty or with a different character class . Lastly , this game has also drawn some flack for its constant internet requirement . Do I like that requirement ? No . Does that affect the game content and the enjoy - ability of the game itself ? In my opinion , no . But obviously if you lack connectivity or have a connectivity issue the \" always on \" requirement will indeed affect your ability to play the game . If you have a steady internet connection , it ' s not really an issue other than where your DRM ideology falls . If you are a hard - core Diablo fan , the new patch is claimed to have fixed many of the early complaints ( which I never experienced ) . If you are new to the franchise , you may want to check it out .\n",

      "Example 0: - - - I ' ve never played D1 or D2 , so some of these things may have been the same in previous games as well - - - * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Diablo 3 isn ' t garbage , but it ' s not that great . I definitely do not think that it is worth $ 60 . If it were $ 20 , that may be a different story . I ' ll break it down into pros and cons ( tldr below ) . Pros : * Graphics - Personally , I like the graphics . I understand that they ' re a bit too \" cartoonified \" for some people , but I think they are aesthetically pleasing . The cinematic graphics are awesome as well . * Voice acting - Okay , see the dialogue con for the other side of this story . I think they chose some good voice actors and these actors did a good job . * Combat - The combat is the only thing that keeps me playing this game ( well , that and friends ) . There are definitely flaws in the combat system , but overall it is pretty fun . You get a lot of really flashy and exciting abilities and the bosses are pretty neat , especially on higher difficulties . * Music - Eh , it ' s decent . I didn ' t want to put it as a con , but it ' s far from the best video game music . WoW has a better soundtrack . Cons : * Dialogue / writing - The dialogue and writing in this game are awful . Although I think the voice actors were pretty good , a lot of their acting seemed bad because of how silly the writing was . There were so many cliche and corny lines that I thought I was watching an episode of Power Rangers during some of the cinematics ( I am justice itself ? . . . ) * Customization ( or lack of ) - There is no customization in this game . It ' s absolutely pathetic and makes me think that Blizzard has gone so far downhill that nothing will ever bring them back . ZERO physical customization . Really ? How hard would it have been for them to at least let us slightly customize our characters in a game where we are often playing ONLINE ? Everyone looks identical . It is boring and incredibly lazy . Whoever decided to scrap physical customization should never work in the gaming industry ever again . There is also next to no class customization either ( you can change your abilities whenever ) . This detracts from the replay value IMMENSELY ( as well as the RP potential . . . actually there is NO RP in this game whatsoever . It might as well just be an action game ) . * Controls - The controls are terrible . This was apparent the second I started playing . You have to click to move AND use some of your abilities . I often find myself randomly running around in circles as I ' m trying to click on enemies that are moving or clicking on the ground to loot . I notice my friends doing this too and it is pretty entertaining ( but annoying and poorly designed ) . * Online Requirement - You must be online for single player . Luckily , I find this game mind numbingly boring by myself , so I ' m always playing with friends , but it is still immensely annoying ( lag and dc ' s happen to me with an awesome connection ; that would bug the hell out of me if I was playing alone ) . * Loot - For a game that ' s centered around loot , you ' d think that it would be more exciting . It ' s not . I guess I expected something like WoW or NWN where you have hundreds to thousands of awesome looking , unique armor and weapons ( instead of generic random stuff ) . * Repetition - It ' s just too repetitive . They would have been better off with only 3 difficulties IMO . Having to play the game FOUR TIMES to beat all the difficulties is ridiculous , considering it already gets repetitive during the first play through . * RL $ AH - Just a stupid way for a greedy company to make extra cash . It ' s a bad idea . I have no idea why anyone would even spend real money on gear for their characters in this game when the gear is so unoriginal anyway . You could buy the best legendary armor with $ but then what are you going to do with it ? ? ? The whole point of the game is to GRIND for loot and work your way through the higher difficulties , so this AH defeats the purpose of the game . Why would a gaming company add something that negates the point of their game ? ( I should also say that I think this will add to the hacking and gold selling market ; I ' m already seeing the spam in chat and it will only get worse ) . * The ending - Perfect example of terrible writing . It was cliche , corny , cheesy , anticlimactic , etc . Act 4 felt rushed , then basically the bad guy dies , hooray we are all happy , humans and angels live together forever omg yay ! ! ! What is this a Disney movie ! ? Normally at the end of a video game ( at least a good one ) , I feel a sense of happiness and sadness ( sad that it ' s over , happy at how much fun I had with it ) . At the end of this I felt annoyed . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * TLDR : Fun for a while , especially with friends , but overall cliche , poorly written , repetitive , and has annoying controls and an online requirement . Worth playing , but NOT for $ 60 .\n",

      "Example 0: You probably already know by my rating that I am not impressed by this game . Maybe I should qualify this with a \" yet . \" I think they are trying to fix things , but they have done so many things wrong so far that I just can ' t give this game a good rating . I have been plagued with problem after problem . I have two copies of this game . My girlfriend and my best friend both bought me a copy without speaking with one another . It was very sweet . Well , I also have two computers that can play this game . One is a custom built computer and the other is a Mac . Well I convinced my girlfriend to play with me . The only problem is . . . well , we couldn ' t play the game together . Why , you might ask ? Well , I could install it on my Mac just fine . There was no problem other than the considerable lag . I had to drop the video settings of course , but there was just constant lag . No , I couldn ' t play with her because there was an installation problem on my PC . It took 3 days of troubleshooting to finally figure it out . You know , uninstall , reinstall , re - download the client . Run as admin . Run in XP mode . Nothing worked . No I had to manually kill the agent . exe process and manually start the process from within a folder before I could actually run Diablo 3 and install it . That made it work . None of the other stuff like updating my system , disabling my anti - virus , running in compatibility mode or anything made this game work . So , Blizzard , you failed big on this one . 3 days without being able to play . What was my next problem ? Oh , the constant lag is a constant problem . Updating things like my network adapter and reworking my wiring didn ' t fix anything . Checking my channels to find the best reception didn ' t help . It still lags . The first few days the servers were constantly down . The auction house IS constantly down . The servers are still constantly down for some kind of maintenance . They threw this piece of crap out onto the market before ever really doing much . This doesn ' t feel like 12 years of planning and thinking for a new game . This feels like some piece of crap game they put together in about a year . Then about a week in my buddy gets hacked and loses all of his stuff . Seems odd , but didn ' t surprise me too much as he isn ' t too big on passwords . I knew that . Oh , but a few days later my account gets hacked . Then I am in the forums noticing that there are a lot of people being hacked . Then another friend was hacked . Does this really sound that common to you ? You think people who have been gaming for years get hacked this easily ? No this was a Blizzard problem . Did they help me out ? Sure . . in a way . Let me tell you how they helped me out . First , it took 24 hours to even respond . Then it took another 24 hours for them to let me know that I had to make sure I understood what a \" rollback \" was . How insulting to my intelligence . Then they finally rolled me back after another 24 hours . They didn ' t offer to give me any gold or help me out in any way . I was out millions of gold in items , 150 , 000 gold in definite gold lost from the roll back , a day lost on a character that I was working on , and the lame moderator just makes some snarky comments and says it ' s all taken care of now . Meanwhile the items I did have depreciated badly because the economy changed so quickly . I basically lost 3 - 4 days worth of game time and all kinds of other things because Blizzard is compromised . I made some suggestions for their security , but I am sure it fell on deaf ears . They just want everyone to use their authenticators because they assure everyone is 100 % impossible to hack . Bullcrap . I ' m not even saying it was impossible to hack me before , but it shouldn ' t have been easy . The only light at the end of the tunnel is that I see some changes coming that might make the game worth swallowing in some ways . There are still tons of problems . They are firm on not letting people go \" free world \" in the game like Diablo 2 . You have to select a quest and go from there . It ' s tedious . The farming is tedious . The game is tedious . There is no more rushing really . The leveling is boring . I ' ll be honest . I would have been happy with Diablo 2 with a few changes in there . I wanted similar characters and play styles . They took powerful characters and a fun game and made it tedious . They were even so arrogant as to point out that \" there is no cow level \" on loading screens . Oh , you mean one of the funnest things in Diablo 2 isn ' t in your game anymore and you think that is a good thing ? Oh , let me shake your hand . Then there is this new unicorn level that they make ridiculously tedious ( noticing a pattern here ) to get into . I haven ' t even gone into it yet , because I don ' t feel like trying to farm the 5 - 6 different pieces required and the 100 , 000 gold item to make the level and not gain anything from it other than maybe a few giggles while slaughtering a unicorn . So far the only words that can describe this game are \" epic fail . \" Epic fail Blizzard .\n",

      "Example 0: I feel the need to email you to tell you just how disappointed I am with the Diablo III game . I have waited a long time , like many , for the third installment to come out . I was able to get it yesterday and installed it today . Though I have a fairly new computer , within a year of purchase and actual age , you worked the game that I would have to spend an extra 30 + dollars in order to play the game . While I understand that you wanted to make the best game possible , you cut off people like myself who haven ' t had the chance of buying an out - in - out game only computer . Thus a $ 60 game jumps to $ 90 - 100 extra dollars within seconds of realizing that I still somehow do not have an advanced video card . I feel let down and left out . I realize that there are a lot of gamers who have such computers already and have topped their computers in order to be able to play such games . I didn ' t realize I had to be in that percent group . I see no need to ever worry about purchasing any other game from your company outside my subscription to World of Warcraft which , strangely enough , is open and easy for even the basic of computers .\n",

      "Example 0: First off , any review that whines about connection issues , lagging , having to have a internet connection , or server wait times ; I would just pass on because these are unrealistic DAs . I read through a good many of these reviews and most are just stupid . The game has even been out for 24hrs and they can ' t understand why there are problems with connects or wait times . This is typical with just about every highly anticipated game that hits the market for PCs . World of Warcraft , Aion , Rift , the MWarfare series , etc . . have all been in this boat . At launch , there are millions trying to connect at the same time and we all should know by now that gaming companies are in it to make money and will only spend just what is needed to get the job done . As for needing a internet connection , we can all blame the pirates and I guarantee some have whined on here in reviews . I played some of Diablo II and it was ok but that was years after the initial release . Nothing to call home in my opinion . Diablo III is definitely an upgrade from its predecessor . It reminds me of Warcraft III and the early Starcraft but more beefed up . The ones that actually offered a proper review are correct , this isn ' t any more than a typical mouse and button spam but that what most games are now a days . Good : - The graphics are pretty good . I would expected better after all the time they took to bring this game online considering the first launch date was moved from 2006 but none the less still good . As for those that whine about graphic issues and lag , get better cards . Just because your system is just above the required doesn ' t been one can play on max . This is typical for all today ' s demanding games . I ' m running a i5 system with two GTX 460s and have no problems what so ever on max settings . - There is a system that allows you to either play solo or in a public setting with either your friends or other players in the diablo community . This is one thing that Blizzard has allows tried to adhere to but creating a system for multiplayer settings . - A pretty decent skill system . There isn ' t a skill path to choose from from what I ' ve seen but you can select which ones to use . You can change skills as needed and well as runes for skills . - There is a crafting system . Haven ' t made it this far yet but it ' s a plus for the game . - Pretty easy to play and get use to before upping the difficulty level . Not so good : ( not saying bad ) - There isn ' t any character customization at all . One would assume after all of these years of developing this game , there would be some sort of customization but there isn ' t . Not good considering it ' s been 10 + years . - The number of classes is lacking . Many of today ' s game that are like this have quite a few different class lines to choose from . There are only 5 in Diablo III . I figured it would have more of a diversity of class selections . - The UI is very lacking . This is very basic , too basic . You get 4 action slots , 2 mouse action selection , and a potion slot . Seven action slots on a UI bar , this is so mid 90s ; however , it works . Summary : If you like the game play of titles such as C & C ; , Red Alert , Starcraft , & Dawn of War ; you ' ll like this game . I know there isn ' t any structure building but the game play is similar ; click , move , and attack . The log on and server situation always works itself out in a matter of days . If you have a problem with having to have an internet connection , then there aren ' t many games today that you will be able to play . This is life and as long as people continue to pirate or torrent games to keep from paying , then this is the outcome . I myself have been playing games for many years as far back as the late ' 80s . This isn ' t a bad game at all but I will truthfully say , I would not pay $ 60 for this game with or without the server problems and DRM . I was able to pick mine up for $ 37 dollar because of a gift card but if it wasn ' t for that I would have waited until the game price was cut in half , which will happen 3ish months from now online . It allows does . I waited 4 months before buying COD : Black Ops and MW3 and only paid half price but that ' s me . No game is worth $ 60 when game play and design isn ' t significantly increased from its predecessor of 12 or so years ago . It ' s worth $ 30 - 40 . I gave it a 4 just because these are the types of games I like to play where I don ' t have to dealt with all the online dregs of society that take the fun out of games ( the reason I dumped MMOs ) . So read the positive reviews and the negative reviews that talk only about game play itself instead of all the whining about connections and lags . Edit : Just to add more from my previous . As many have said , there isn ' t really any skill in this game . It has a lot of potential but not a lot of thought was added through 10years of planning . Two positives in that once you level both blacksmith and jewel crafting , it is available to all characters . So , gold is saved in not having to level it through all characters but only JC is viable until after lvl 60 is obtained and other BS plans are found . There are five character types and you have I believe 8 - 9 slots for characters . I ' m not sure why there are more than 5 because just about every character has a cookie cutter skill base that pretty much most use to complete the game on the highest level . Most skills and skill runes are just junk and worthless for progression . If you haven ' t figured it out through other readings , this game is made to force you through three play throughs in order to obtain the highest level of 60 . Each play through has an increase in hardness and contains 4 Acts per play through . So , it can be boring . The one thing Blizz did was add many maps of each instance you have to navigate so there is a slight variety in maps and the types of mini - bosses change . Once one gets through the second play through if you manage to get by Diablo the second time , the game turns into an equipment oriented game . Without a specific type of gear , you will have a very difficult and frustrating time at playing . The problem with this is that the auction house is outrageous in its prices at least for another few months or so when more lvl60s will be available and farming , which should bring the ignorant prices down . Plus , this game is already riddled with gold farmers . For those that don ' t know what they are , they are players that are hired and paid to farm the game for gold ( currency ) that it then sold on the internet for real money . These same players are also selling gear on the auction house , which drives the costs up and also places gold in their pockets to sell for money . Blizzard has no control for these people at all . It ' s a constant spam session the moment you enter into general chat . There are actually items on the AH that go for millions of gold that are considered decent but not great items . I just started Act 2 on the third run through ( Hell level ) and only collected 1 . 7 million in gold . You do the math , that doesn ' t buy a whole lot of decent gear . As I mentioned in the original post , if you have friends you can get help in problematic areas or you can find help in the Diablo community from those that don ' t act like prima donnas . So in a nut , this game is very gear centric after the nightmare level ( second run through ) , which are Hell and Inferno levels . You will be required to buy from the AH , so save all your gold and prepare for high prices . Bid on too high priced items and buy out lower ones . Most are trolling the AH to buy low priced items to re - auction them for higher prices . This is what screwed the AH system in WoW in it early days .\n",

      "Example 0: Total cash grab . Drops are basically tightly controlled and meted out , with the goal of forcing you into the real money auction house to progress . Basically the gameplay itself is fun , until you get to Inferno mode , in which case you need really good gear to progress . I played hours upon hours and never got anything I could use . Basically the only thing to do is sell little odds and ends and flip stuff on the AH for a profit , then slowly buy yourself upgrades . The problem is , the stuff you need for Inferno mode costs so much , that it ' s practically impossible to get . Unless you break out your wallet . This is not a game that includes an Auction House , this is an auction house that includes a game . The whole thing was designed to force you into the AH , to line Blizzard ' s pockets .

The character customization is so neutered in this game that I felt like my character wasn ' t even mine . All of the abilities are pre - assigned and I ' m not allowed to allocate any stat points . I have a level 40 Wizard in Nightmare mode which I have no further desire to play with since I ' ve maxed out his abilities and really can ' t progress further . The other glaring downside to this game are the terrible gear drop ratios . Blizzard could fix this with a patch but I have suspicions that they purposelly made the gear drops lousy in order to coerce people into using the Auction House .

      "Example 0: Diablo 3 . . . one of the most anticipated games in a very long time which broke preorder records . The game was hyped to no end . And why shouldnt it ? Diablo 2 was a great game and still manages to hook players in for being more than 10 years old which is a testament to how good it was . Diablo 3 , however , was a letdown and failure in every possible way , and a slap in the face to fans who have been waiting so long for the third installment . First problem , was of course the launch . Blizzard knew they had a massive amount of people preordering the game . Beta and stress tests were run , so theres no excuse for what happened when the game went live . Servers crashed , and people trying to log in were essentially blocked from playing a game they paid for . The online only play method proved to be a horrible idea that only punished customers and became apparent the first day . Instead of preparing for the launch and overcompensating for the huge demand , Blizzard chose to go the bare minimum route to see just how few servers they could get away with to run the game . It took about a week for the log in issues to be resolved , but even after that , the people that could finally log in were greeted with horrible server lag and pings that were in the 250 - 700 range which meant huge delays with what was happening on screen , and even more trouble for people who attempted to play hardcore mode . The game would freeze up for a few seconds , and you would find your character permanently dead after the server re - synced . To this day the game is still unoptimized and people with higher end systems are still experiencing bugs such as the infamous stuttering problem which was present from the beta and never fixed even though Blizzard said it would be for the release . Blizzard famously adopted the \" it will be released when its finished \" viewpoint on the game . However , seems they didnt stick with that for long since the game was released unfinished , buggy , and missing many features , biggest of all being arena combat and PVP . It was rushed to market to appease stockholders and report financial gains plain and simple . The graphics are a mixed bag . On one side , they dont look terrible and the effects look nice . On the other , the atmosphere is not Diablo at all . Instead of a dark and dreary world , they chose to make it colorful and cartoonish to an extent to mirror World of Warcraft . Gameplay wise , the game was somewhat fun , but only on the first playthrough . Combat and skills work nicely together , yet when you finish the game on normal mode , theres not much more reason to play . The game just gets a little bit harder on the next difficulty , but the story and quests remain exactly the same . Acts 1 and 2 were somewhat interesting and varied . However , Act 3 , and to a higher extent Act 4 , seem very rushed and bland . The storyline for the game was also pretty boring and uninspired and you can tell the people that did the original games had nothing to do with this one . Inferno mode which is the highest difficulty , just turns into grinding mobs to farm high end gear . The drops in Diablo 3 have become extremely rare to get anything good , which means you need to go to the auction house to get halfway decent items . However , this makes the game just feel like pay to win which essentially it is with the addition of the real money auction house . The auction house has also made gold practically worthless . Botters and farmers have driven prices in the auction house to insane levels where it costs 500 million gold or more for decent items , and the value of gold is dropping daily . Blizzard even patched the game to make equipment repairs cost more money so youre constantly fixing your gear and not making any money to buy anything . For $ 60 , there just isnt any value in this game . Its no longer a Diablo game , and I guess that should have been clear since most of the team that made the first two games have left Blizzard . If it didnt have Diablo in the title and was named something else , it wouldnt have sold anywhere as well as it did . They should have just named this World of Warcraft : Heroes or something like that because its exactly what this game is . A WoW spinoff and cash - in attempt by Blizzard to exploit their fans for money . Save your money , its just not worth it for what they did to this game .\n",

      "Example 0: I really really really wanted to love this game . I have held healthy addictions to Diablo and Diablo 2 since the beginning , and I had preordered Diablo 3 the moment Amazon had it available . I had extremely high hopes as I grinded my way through each level . . but those high hopes began to diminish as the repetitiveness of playing each act over and over , and then over again became more and more grueling . But finally , I had reached level 60 and I began filling my inventory with rares found in Act 1 of inferno ( the highest ) difficulty . And then I discovered that I had to play act 1 inferno literally hundreds of times in order to find the items necessary to advance past act 2 , and I realized the repetitiveness only gets worse . But I was addicted to the rush you get when you identify a bag full of rares , and that rush you get when a legendary or even set item drops , so I kept playing . For some reason I told myself it would become more fun than addictive , but trust me , that never happens . Blizzard took a page out of Zynga Games ' book and focused on getting people hooked on the addictiveness rather than getting them hooked on the fun . And then , of course , Blizzard opens up the real money auction house . And so , people are almost forced to buy and sell items through the RMAH ( I myself bought something for $ 45 like a sucker , because I was so frustrated one day that I wasn ' t finding anything decent in my many rare runs , even with 190 % magic find ) . And , of course , Blizzard takes 30 % of every dollar spent in the RMAH , and so you realize how they are making their money . . not from selling millions of copies of a $ 50 + game , but from virtual items that don ' t actually exist . In the end , I found that I had wasted almost 100 hours of my time playing a video game that I hated . I lied to myself because I wanted to love it so bad , and I lied to myself because I couldn ' t see that I was hooked to the game for the wrong reasons . I even lied to myself the moment I first created my character and found that skill progression was dumbed down to the likes of a Harry Potter game made for children . . I should have quit then , but of course that is easy to say now . Just stay away , because the game is not going to get better . It is painfully obvious that each update benefits Blizzard and ignores the gamer . A good game community has a healthy balance of pleasing the customer and benefiting the company , but they found a way to ignore that by getting people like me sucked into a world of finding countless rares .\n",

      "Example 0: Like many other gamers , I eagerly awaited the release of this title , for quite some time . Also like other reviewers , I am saddened by the final product . Here is why . 1 . The biggest reason I am so disappointed in D3 is the Real Money Auction House ( RMAH ) . I knew it was going to be in the game , but the thought didn ' t bother me . I ' ve never planned to purchase items or gold with real money . The major problem is that Blizzard has seen fit to design the game so that you will NEED to purchase items and gold from the AH in order to progress without some maddening gear grind that would take a lifetime . In short , they have set the game up to require use of the AH , in order to profit from the resultant transaction fees . 2 . Absolutely terrible online service . This game is required to be connected to the internet at all times while playing , but the company has provided sub - standard service that results in frequent disconnects , server downtime , and constant gameplay lag . For those of you that are familiar with Blizzard games , you know that their past titles have been superb award - winning masterpieces . This is NOT one of them . As a matter of fact , this game feels very little like a Blizzard game . I ' m completely shocked that they have released something as bad as this .\n"

      "Example 0: Diablo 3 has been one of those games that has been labelled as garbage and it ' s really a shame . I believe there are three main complaints against the game : 1 ) Real Money Auction HousePeople feel that this breaks the game because others can come in with real money , do half the work , and be ready to take on the mobs in Inferno . First off , no . You can have the BEST gear in the game , and still get your butt handed to you in Inferno , even with the recent patches ( I ' ve played since day 1 ) . Navigating through mobs in Inferno takes skill , patience , and practice ; regardless of gear . Anyone who claims that a person can just spend $ X dollars in the RMAH , get to Inferno level , and beat it - hasn ' t played Inferno . In fact , I believe this is why Blizzard did not put the RMAH in Hardcore . You realize how much money they could of made ? Things in Hardcore are worth MUCH more than Softcore - yet greedy , horrible Blizzard left the RMAH out . Why ? Because they clearly say that under NO circumstance will you get your character back . Could you IMAGINE the number of morons who would blow hundreds of dollars on HC characters , thinking it would buy them a one - way ticket to dominating Inferno difficulty , then lose their character ( money ) and FREAK ! RMAH being withheld from the Hardcore server was a move where Blizzard chose to not deal with annoyed customers over money - a genuinely greedy company wouldn ' t of cared , wouldn ' t of passed out on the cash cow that RMAH HC could be . Secondly , being mad that someone who works the 9 to 5 and wants to spend some of their hard earned cash on a few items ( or more ) to make them feel more powerful in game is just insane . It ' s THEIR money ! \" But I worked hard without money to get all of this gear ! \" Well , good for you ! * slow clap * And Jack / Jill works hard to get money that they can spend how they want . Get a job , you ' ll know what I mean when I say that sometimes you don ' t have the time to farm ( even if you ' d like to ) but you really want to catch up with your friends that are on Inferno MP - 6 . For the record , I ' ve never used the RMAH - yet I still respect those that make the choice to use it . 2 ) Always Online / Server Error at LaunchAlways online is a feature that many games were forcing long before Diablo ( and soon consoles will be forcing it , too ) . Is it annoying ? Sure , but so are taxes on my paycheck . But at the end of the day , no one want ' s to get ripped off . And while you may not like that you can ' t play Diablo on your laptop during your wifi absent family vacation , Blizzard doesn ' t like that pricks out their steal something they worked hard to make . Granted , you have the right to not like the always - online rule , but to DOWNVOTE it is an unfair marker of the games quality - you ' re essentially saying , \" Even if this was the best game ever made , because it forces me to always be online , I recommend you don ' t buy it . \" Plus , I don ' t want to deal with security issues / hackers / bugs to the game , and alway - online is one way to fight against this . Sucks for you , but I am the one playing the game at the end of the day . Error at Launch . . . Ugh , get over it . It was a mistake . It sucked . And I couldn ' t play Diablo 3 for 12 hours . Am I the ONLY person who is not a game - addict here ? ! The other sentiment is that , \" I paid for it and couldn ' t play it ! \" Firstly , read your terms of service that you accept . Secondly , how often has an employer paid you on the hour while you were texting , goofing off , etc ? Big deal , we ' re human . Mistakes happen . It wasn ' t consistent . 3 ) Grinding / It ' s Just Not the SameREALLY ? ! Does no one remember how much a grind fest Diablo 1 / 2 could be ? Less variety in gear might of meant less grinding , but the expense is less variety ! It ' s a dungeon crawler . . . Of all the complaints I read / hear about the game , I RARELY see \" it wasn ' t fun \" , \" the characters suck \" , \" the skills suck \" , etc . Aka , I RARELY see actual negativity towards the key component - general game play . Too me , it ' s lest of a one - track grind than Diablo 1 / 2 by FAR due to the increase in A . I . When I ' m playing HC on my lv 60 - 3 at Inferno , I ' m always encountering new situations where my heart begins to race as I know the fight is on and my character could bite the dust any moment now . Humans have a tendency to look on the past with an exaggerating positive light . This isn ' t my theory , it ' s fact . Actually listened to a recent TED talk about . Ever had a ex bf / gf / friend , where you find yourself missing them until a friend or some other circumstance makes you realize , \" Wow , it was never as good as I thought it was . . . \" Diablo 1 / 2 are GREAT . AMAZING ! BRILLIANT ! I will always hold them near to my heart , as I played them as a child during a time where they brought a lot of stress - relief to my life and allowed me to bond with my cousin of the same age as we played . I will always owe Diablo 1 / 2 some of my sanity , and I could never betray that game . That being said , when you try and compare the feelings of nostalgia banked by playing D / D2 with the present gameplay of D3 , of course Diablo 3 is going to fail - miserably . But anyone who takes an honest assessment of what makes a game a game - gameplay , A . I . , story , visuals , depth , etc will see that D3 is a MAJOR improvement . Everyone knows that , hypothetically , if Diablo 3 was the \" perfect \" game , it still would have failed because it just can ' t live up to the unrealistic expectations of being a game that is in your heart and has been there for years . It ' s impossible . That being said , I really like the game for the GAME itself .\n",

Not to mention the graphics and some monsters were pulled right from WoW . This is not Diablo . The game hits hack and slash alright but many other games do it better . This game is a blight on the franchise that Spawned this type of game especially after a 12 year wait . I was rather bored playing , the world feels detached and wooden compared to d1 and d2s world that sucked you in . If this game had a different name then diablo it would be easier to swallow but it felt like they spit in the eye of the franchise with this . And the RMAH feels scammy .

      "Example 0: For gamers who played the older Blizzard games and are considering purchasing Diablo 3 , take note - this is NOT the same Blizzard . I don ' t know what changed - maybe the programmers , directors , I don ' t know - but this game lacks the polish , strong story / lore , and fun gameplay that was the old Blizzard ' s hallmark . Pros : Good way to kill time , mixing abilities / gear is fun at first , looks alrightCons : Lag in a single player game is horrible , should never happen yet Blizzard refuses to fix it for unexplained reasons . Also , lack of an offline option is ridiculous , it doesn ' t stop cheating / piracy and is terrible for loyal customers . Gameplay becomes very old , very fast . Story and lore are both horrendous , equivalent to a bad children ' s fantasy novel . Auction house was a very poor effort . Overall - I have purchased almost every single Blizzard game since Warcraft 2 , but I will never purchase another Blizzard product again unless they fix the lag and remove the requirement for constant online access .\n",

      "Example 0: Okay , this game is just AWFUL . And this is coming from someone who spent over 100 hours on it and beat the game on Inferno with my Wizard so I ' ve given the game more than its fair chance . The first couple of times of beating the game are very fun , especially with friends , I will hand it to Blizzard . The art is nice , the music is not bad , and the environments are somewhat interesting . Then you reach the brick wall that is known as Inferno ( the hardest difficulty ) and you realize what Blizzard has been planning all along . The mobs in Inferno suddenly become godlike and all your gear becomes instantly obsolete . Elites and even regular mobs will kick your ass unless you upgrade your very quickly . To make matters worse the game PUNISHES YOU for playing co - op on Inferno , the already disgustingly difficult mobs become near godly and unless you and your friends are supremely geared it ' s going to be an excruciating exercise in futility . Problem is that 95 % of the loot you get in Inferno is literally garbage , so bad that even the NPC vendors will be reluctant to accept them . Magic find increases the chances of getting yellow items , but chances are they are still crap . There are far too many possible attributes during item rolls , so as a result you will almost always get items which make no sense whatsoever ( example : Wizard hat with Strength , or Barbarian sword with Intelligence , etc . ) and weapons in Act 4 of Inferno with 200 DPS . It ' s infuriating . It is so bad that when I killed Diablo on Inferno he dropped only blues , and not just any blues but TERRIBLE blues , stuff so bad you wouldn ' t even use it on Hell difficulty . So you ' re thinking to yourself , WHY WHY WHY would they do this ? ! Why make the mobs so difficult and the gear so bad ? ! ? ! WELL LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WE REACH THE GOAL OF BLIZZARD ' S GAME DESIGN IN DIABLO 3 : THE REAL MONEY AUCTION HOUSE ! ! ! As stated Inferno is so ridiculously difficult and the loot generally so bad that the ONLY WAY to progress is to use the Auction House . I only managed to beat the game by bidding low gold on items and shopping intelligently , but it took wayyyy longer than it should have . Not only this , I was BASICALLY FORCED TO USE THE AUCTION HOUSE TO BEAT THE GAME . Trust me this isn ' t just unique to me because I suck , 90 % of my friends gave up at Inferno Act 1 , those that stayed have had no choice but to use the Auction House as well . The game isn ' t skill dependent , it is only gear based . PROBLEM IS that the gold prices of items have flown through the roof due to inflation , botters , and exploiters . So expect to see any half decent weapon for at least 10 million gold , which is no small amount of money . So a lot of people have resorted to using the Real Money Auction House and it ' s absolute chaos . I ' ve seen people spending over $ 500 ( yes real cash ) on a SINGLE ITEM , a virtual item folks that will probably be obsolete in the next patch or expansion . I personally don ' t believe in spending real money on video game items ( especially absurd amounts like stated above ) but to each his own . - - - - - So I really can ' t help but feel like the entire game was designed to revolve around the Real Money Auction House . The difficulty is absurd at inferno , many of the bosses are basically gear - checks ( can only be beaten with certain amounts of DPS ) and the loot is so bad that you have no choice but to use the Auction House . This game is a money grab , it ' s pay to win , and I ' m not sticking around for when they implement Player vs . Player where it ' s going to be the battle of the credit cards . I will admit that I got more than my money ' s worth and it was fun at times , but this franchise has been ruined and this is by FAR the worst Blizzard game I have ever played . I will not remember this fondly like I do Diablo 2 or the Starcraft Series . SHAME ON YOU BLIZZARD , THIS GAME IS A SCAM4 / 10\n",

Meaning killing monsters to increase your level and getting better gear . 1 % is selling unwanted gear and listening to a boring story . But what is your reward for all the hard work ? In Lineage 2 or WOW you grind and gather gear so you can participate in PVP or siege battles with other players . In this game what is the point , after you beat Diablo in the last act , there is nothing else to do . Just play the same boring story over again ?

I ' m not sure what took so long to release this game - the story is bad , the game play leaves a lot to be desired , and the communication with players is awful . Even the art - meh . I would hope for better in the future , but we can all see what Blizzard has become . Replay Diablo 1 and 2 . Leave it at that .\n",

      "Example 0: There is no reason to play this game over Diablo 2I ' ve been through entire game on my DH , and up to inferno on my monk , but I don ' t see any reason to keep playing . All my friends have already called it crap and stopped . I started out playing DH , but now that everyone else has rerolled DH . . . takes the fun out of it . With game degrading mechanics all around ranging from : - max party size is 4 . . . why . . . I could make a whole list of reasons why this number is ridiculous . big part of why my group is no longer playing - drm . . . you have to play on their laggy , unreliable servers , no hardcore until this is resolved - don ' t farm for item , buy them at the AH - implemented crafting system , that is worthless - buy your items at the AH - don ' t farm for gold , buy it at the AH - character customization is very limited , once you reach inferno your already limited customization is usually reduced to 1 build with MINOR variations - rune system is gone , yet even less customization - every class has about - + 24 abilities , 1 / 3 of these are actually useful - some entire classes are just crap - hi witch doctor - inferno is pretty much just for ranged characters . everyone i know has re - rolled sorc or demon hunter - the game is build around that you will use the AH to buy gear to upgrade , but the insane prices on the AH make it impossible for new players to gear out . mind you that is today , I can ' t imagine 4 - 5 years from now . - bosses only drop loot the first time you kill them , no matter what the mode of difficulty - inferno isn ' t fun , 1 shotted from off screen = not fun , 1 shotted from everything = not fun , it ' s not even challenging , it ' s just stupid - once you hit inferno act 1 , be prepared to farm farm farm for cash before you can progress to act 2 . . . for days - character growth / scaling is insane . . . at level 50 you are using a 200 dmg weapon i believe , by 55 500 , by 60 1600 . the scaling makes no sense , why linear growth the entire game until the end then exponential . - max character level is only 60 , you are 60 long before you beat inferno , this appears to be a decision late in the development process which i imagine contributes to the terrible character scaling in the 50s . - most classes get their best abilities by 20 , . . . why - auction house constantly down / very laggy - some classes ( DH , Monk ) are WAY better than others at the moment , this can only lead to character normalization or everyone playing the same class . the classes just aren ' t well thought out . they should each be uniquely powerful , and they aren ' t . only the ones with invincibility excel , no other contributing factor - the levels move almost exactly like D2 , really . . . all you could do is send us to 1 new place ? ? ? - introduced new chat system , to promote gold sales / spam from third party vendors ? i guess they partner with anyone that pays , because you can ' t tell me at this point in life they aren ' t aware of spammers , this is far from their first game . - no set bonuses , there are set items , but the bonuses are just normal bonuses like + 25 str - itemization as a whole is terrible . every item no matter what it is , rare , set , legendary , just gets random + stats . . . could be int on a sword , some bows come with + stats to witch doctor weapons - no armor types , any class can wear any type of armor , it changes depending on whose holding it - LAME - legendary items can have worse stats than blues of the same level - ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? - i ' ve had one legendary drop - level 34 item , that ' s insane - one full game clear , and another char up to inferno - the same amount of magic find , doesn ' t increase drops like having NV - giving you the same amount of magic find does . there is a hidden mechanic - merc AI is way worse than D2 - mercs do no dmg , provide little support / purposeImprovements over Diablo 2 : - great party system . . . based on DRM , and the annoying and confusing blizzard battle tag or whatever its called - graphics - sound - Nephalem Valor is a fun idea , but locks you into playing lengthy sessions , and for some reason punishes you for switching between your limited skills . Wouldn ' t be surprised to see a lawsuit about how some terrible moms kid couldn ' t leave his computer because he didnt want to lose his 5 stacks . Final thought : The auction house killed this game . Yes , you can choose not to use it , but that isn ' t how the game is designed to be played . Loot drops have been reduced overall as the game is designed with you using the AH in mind . The kids who have never played D2 will enjoy this game , however it ' s rated M so technically they shouldn ' t be playing it .\n",

      "Example 0: I defeated the game , beat inferno on monster power 5 , ( theres no point to even doing monster power anyway since the rewarded key for farming is complete garbage 98 % of the time ) . Where to beginthe game took everything that made Diablo II LoD good , and threw it all out in the trash and kept everything that made the game boring . thenthey added an RMAH / AH to make sure that you don ' t find any of your own gear ( the entire point of the game was supposed to be leveling up skills and finding your own gear to make your skills more powerful , ie + 1 to all skills ) , but no they even removed that \" feature \" you can ' t level spells and abilities up , every spell you get is as powerful as its ever going to be ( no room for improvement ) , your skills dont even matter , since everything is based off Main - Stat and Weapon Damage , the only reason to change spells is because you dont like the animation or appearance of a spell , since the spells effects are meaningless ( they dont do anything but do damage ) ; so all the spells feel bland / feel the same . / pointless you could equip \" throw squirel \" and it would do same damage as \" Fire Beam \" . The wizard is a joke , Teleport is horrible . In Short , if you were a fan of the past 3 Diablo releases ( 1 2 lod ) you will probably be disappointed with this release , hold off till Diablo 4 or to see if they bring the game back in line with its roots in an expansion . As it stands the game is unplayable by any measure . . . . complete garbage . . . . its a money grab box they might as well of shipped an empty box .\n",

      "Example 0: one major flaw ruins this entire game . . . yes you guessed it , persistent internet connection is required . If you are not connected to Battle . net servers at all times the game WILL NOT function . . . period ! so if you disconnect mid boss fight or right before you reach a checkpoint , yep you guessed it , all your progress will be lost and you will have to start from your previous checkpoint . No , there is no SAVE GAME function in Diablo 3 , the servers auto save for you at each checkpoint only . Personally , the game content itself could be phenominal and I really wouldn ' t care , the explicit decision to make a \" single player game \" a INTERNET ONLY game is absolutely convolted idiocy . Unless Blizzard makes HUGE changes to this game I would be seriously surprised if this game continues to sell its copies . To be clear , I did not by this game . I was one of the many who received a free copy for commiting to WOW for a year . Having said that , I would not buy this game nor recommend it to anyone . I would recommend it to someone I disliked to have sweet revenge but that is it .\n",

      "Example 0: By far the greatest disappointment in gaming since Duke Nukem Forever came out . This game was over 11 years in the making and when it finally was released it was filled with bugs , exploits , server issues , and no single player offline mode . You are required to connect to the servers in order to even play a game by yourself , the reasoning behind this is that it prevents people from making illegal copies and / or duping or hacking the game . Fine , but what it also does is limit your ability to play a product you paid for , you cannot play if you have no internet connection , if the servers are down or out , or your connection is not \" stable \" ( NZ and Australian players know this fact ! ) . Why not add a single player mode only that cannot then be transferred online for play for those who wish to enjoy the game when the internet is not an option or the servers are out ? Aside from the glaring requirement of being connected in order to play there are the issues with the game play itself . Things like \" rubberbanding \" and latency cause your character to just suddenly die , issues further compounded by insane graphical requirements even at the lowest of settings . Systems that run over 1 GB of video memory still experience framerate stutter and tearing on a game with graphics less intense than something made 5 years ago . This is owed to the MPQ files that are used as a resource to render the world , these objects are stored on the Hard Drive and must be accessed constantly to generate the terrain . This means that they are subject to read time delays , even fast 10 , 000 RPM disks are going to struggle to keep up . The best solution has been to store these files on a SSD separately , which is a ridiculous fix that should not need to be implemented simply to make the game run smoothly . The game itself is a progression , like Diablo 2 or Dungeon Siege 2 , beating certain difficulties unlocks more challenging ones . However the story is exactly the same , the enemies simply get harder to kill . This means there is no real end game . For those that have \" seen it all \" and \" done it all \" , such as beating the hardest difficulty or mastering the \" Hardcore Mode \" ( another failed attempt to challenge players , what good is a 1 death system when things like lag or framerate issues can kill you as surely as any enemy ) this means the game has no replay value whatsoever . There is nothing to do but wait for more content to be released . A ladder system or PvP such as was introduced in D2 would alleviate this , but Blizzard prefers to invest time in their cash cow , the Real Money Auction House ( RMAH ) . Which brings me to my final point , the game is custom designed to make good items hard to find so that players will be forced to resort to buying the items they need to proceed . It is in Blizzard ' s best interests to make good items hard to get , because if everyone can get them on their own no one will sell them in the RMAH and Blizzard will not receive its commissions . The economy of the game is of course broken because the people with all the good items are the botters , hackers , exploiters , and cheaters who took advantage of loopholes and continue to take advantage of the game in order to profit . These people , for the most part , work out places like Korea and China , dedicating untold hours to grinding the game in order to gather their loot which they then sell at premium prices to those too ignorant or desperate to know better than to buy them . This game was fundamentally flawed in the way it was developed , released , and is now currently being managed . Blizzard needs to stop the RMAH and increase the drop rates of quality items across the board . This is a game people play for fun in order to challenge themselves to get better at it , not a money making endeavor that is meant to line the pockets of the company that made it . For these reasons I have stopped playing the game , since I received my copy for free when I purchased a yearly subscription to World of Warcraft I am one of the few fortunate souls who was not robbed for 60 dollars for a failure of a product .\n",

      "Example 0: This game and I have a rough relationship , I want to love it , but it ' s so hard to . The first few days were really bad , and the updates have helped just not enough to really bring me back . I ran out of game after about a few weeks of play . Got board with it , and well moved on .

      "Example 0: This game is just depressingly bad . The entire game is built around an auction house that to the very core is featureless and hard to use . You are limited to 3 filters on an item search . You cannot filter by those search filters . You cannot filter by bid value or duration left . The game is designed around a cookie cutter for total morons . Basically Blizzard tells you how to play the game every step of the way . How to build your character . What stats you should gear for , what skills to use , etc . They have consistently let exploiters go unpunished , while at the same time nerfing legitimate player builds citing that they are too powerful . The economy is so inflated due to only being able to post 10 items every 3 days on the auction house . THIS WAS AN INTENTIONAL DESIGN . Blizzard wants to encourage people not to play their game legitimately rather than spend their money in the RMAH buying items . The final difficulty mode ( Inferno ) is designed so that players brick wall upon entering every new act . This too is done to intentionally force players to visit the auction house ( RMAH or otherwise , it is impossible to collect the gear necessary to advance . ) Overall , a low quality game . I give it 1 / 5 stars .\n",

      "Example 0: I was pretty excited about Diablo 3 since its predecessors were two of my all - time favorite games . Diablo 3 , on the other hand , ranks right up there with pile surgery on the entertainment front . Why ? Because Battle . net is a pain in the ass . After trying to log in to play the game most of the day , only to receive a useless message that Battle . net is under maintenance , I was finally able to log in . What few minutes I did get to play before the system crashed , due to a failure in the connection to Battle . net , seemed a bit promising , but so far I ' m still waiting for Diablo 3 to be released . I ' m guessing the CDs and downloads that were made available today were part 1 of the Diablo 3 release . I have no idea when part two , the part where you can actually play the game , will occur . I recommend skipping this game , at least for now . UPDATE : Now that the issues with the Battle . net servers seems to have been solved , I would recommend Diablo 3 . I like the improvements to game play over the previous Diablo games , in particular , the way that the town portal and identifying objects works is much improved . I also like the fact that I don ' t have to spend time rearranging my pack all the time . I will provide more information as I play the game .\n",

      "Example 0: To get this out of the way , Diablo 3 was just shy of a perfect score for the obvious reason . It ' s an issue that has probably been the basis for all of this game ' s reviews on Amazon . com , but one more time . . . I don ' t care what Blizzard Entertainment explains for this DRM approach , it ' s a very strange and aggravating decision for a dungeon crawl action RPG . A majority of classic Diablo and Diablo 2 players are strict and have every right to be on this issue ; always online to play a single player game is in truth moronic . After that hump , on to the review ! Please note that this reviewer was not a dedicated Diablo 2 player . I played it back then for almost 2 hours and I hated the bland and stiff combat animations . I was more of an RTS PC gamer in the past from loving Warcraft III and Starcraft . One year sober from World of Warcraft , I gave Diablo 3 a try thanks to my friends on battle . net convincing me to play it . 77 hours later and at the time was still logging in to play with either my 53 Wizard on Hell Difficulty or my 36 Barbarian on nightmare Difficulty . Diablo 3 was fun as hell even with the irony of that statement . Character and combat animations be it melee to spell casting or other strange combinations , are all unique . Watching your character wreck havoc on enemies and the environment are visually entertaining . This game is very M - Rated as soon as you attack your first enemy . Things get more gory as you can expect from a Diablo game . The more your round up and kill , the more body parts and blood splatters everywhere so you will be trying to get the perfect skill set to demolish and to survive . So what if the graphics look like 2007 ' s standards ? It ' s about the smash , loot , level game play that Diablo is famous for . As soon as the loot drops from elites or bosses in the game , this is where your focus goes towards . The higher the level , the better chances for new gear and weapons . Strangely the always online issue did become a convenience as players are able join with other players and friends almost immediately . The only problem is when battle . net is down for maintenance or IT issues . Right now I prefer to play Diablo 3 with a buddy than by myself especially on the harder difficulties . There are other short comings with Diablo 3 that I would like to point out though besides the main one . Two are what I expected to be in Diablo 3 thanks to playing Runic game ' s , Torchlight . * Firstly , The skill system is strange and constricted . You have a total of 6 button slots to map your characters abilities . When you have all six , you ' ll wish you had more for those really helpful abilities you swapped out for those dire moments in harder difficulties . Annoyingly though switching runes for your abilities have a delay for some really dumb reason . * Secondly , the companions are a bit disappointing . They can ' t help you with loot storage or sell your crap items for you . You have to head back into town via town portal or waygates to sell almost every hour . They are a bit chatty , but nothing near as annoying as Dragon ' s Dogma . * Third , crafting can be a chore with that minimal reward . it ' s bad enough when you discover rare items only to reveal them worthless , you will craft many weapons and pieces of armor and be just as disappointed . But when you get one worth a damn , it ' s like a gift from the gods . * Fourth , the story / campaign progression is a little clich & eacute ; and linear . Although the BADASS CGI cinematics and other dialogue situations are Blizzard showing off another \" tour de force \" of really good storytelling , you will be pressing spacebar or ESC to just skip them after you finish the normal difficulty . * Fifth , the main bosses are disappointingly easy compared to the trash elite or rare enemies you encounter . The higher the difficulty , the harder ( almost keyboard smashing cursing out loud ) they become . Make sure when you log out of Diablo 3 , you do it back in town . But like all Blizzard games , there is always room for improvement . I ' m expecting lots of hot - fix and content patches in the future because Blizzard does know how to keep player bases content . ( Seriously , stop giving me that look , you know it ' s true ) . Announced PVP is on the way for the patient . The only people who will have issues or give the 3 or below star ratings are the die - hard Diablo 2 fans who probably were still playing prior to D3 ' s release . This game will probably never be near as the \" gift from god to nerds \" as they want it to be , but frankly it was worth the price to me for the first 4 times I did all 4 acts . The only real competition for this game in the action RPG genre will be Torchlight II . I suggest own both of them regardless if you love action RPGs because so far they are both fun to own . * ( updated ) I now have one character in Inferno and one almost 60 in Hell difficulty , and I pretty much stopped and moved on . Playing the same ACTS I ' ve done twice has now become boring . The fact that the rare elite packs almost one shotting you each time you encounter them , just starts to lose its excitement . The \" out of time \" debuff boss elites now have really killed the enjoyment . The RMAH is pretty ridiculous . I made it to ACT II after struggling and learning new tactics and farming gear , and I am bored . I don ' t ' have the initiative to want to play anymore pretty much . The game to me was worth the $ 60 price tag as I put in 100 + hours in Diablo 3 . I may re - install to try out PVP with my friends .\n",

      "Example 0: The worst : You have to be connected to the internet to play . Not only were the servers screwed up on launch day , not allowing anyone on until about 4pm eastern time , but anytime their servers are clogged , your SINGLE PLAYER game gets lagged an unplayable . I just had to close the game because I was walking around on a single player game and no mobs were generating lag was making the game unplayable . That ' s unacceptable . I paid $ 60 for this game , and I can ' t play a single player game because of lag ? That ' s crazy . I hear blizzard has been making this the norm lately ( StarCraft2 ? ) , and if it continues , I ' ll never buy one of their games again . It ' s understood for an mmorpg like WoW , but for a single player game ? It ' s really something that gamers should rebel over . Bad : The game itself is nothing to write home about . It ' s no different than diablo 1 or 2 . Actually , it ' s super dumbed down . It only allows you to map 4 skills to your 1 - 4 keys ( Q is for your potion ) , and you only get access to the higher numbers when you ' ve gained enough levels . You can ' t mix and match skills to your hot keys , and make the most of your character . And the game ? It ' s exactly like the previous ones , only more boring since you ' ve already seen it before . Bunch of monsters come , you mow them down , and nothing new or exciting happens . It ' s incredibly linear , and just ho hum . It ' s playable , don ' t get me wrong , but it ' just not exciting or really fun in any way . This is not worth it . I ' m going back to finishing up Skyrim , which is a much better time investment .\n",

      "Example 0: This was the first game that I truly bought into the hype and purchased full price within the early goings of the release . It just made sense . Many of my friends were playing this game . This was the most hyped game in the history of PC gaming thus far . So , I gave it a try . The first time through the game was amazing . But , as you go along , there are far too many limitations and unpolished aspects of the game . The Good * The heroes . There are a wide variety classes - The Barbarian , Monk , Demon Hunter , Witch , and the Wizard . Lots of different characters to play with . Barbarian for the close range , physical prowess . Demon Hunter for the long range sniping and shooting ability . Witch and Wizard with spells and spiritual powers . * Beautiful settings . Dirt , night , day , villages , fire , hell , heaven , everything looks gorgeous * The first time through the game is epic , until the very last ACT . The ACT was just disappointing . I couldn ' t even believe when I killed Diablo . I figured it should have been a bit more difficult . Still , the first half and through the first part of the 2nd half is pulse pounding fun . * Looting . It ' s quite fun . And addictive . * Armor and weapons upgrading . Highly addictive to a certain extent . There are attributes that make certain armor and weapons more appealing , including vitality , regeneration , gold find , and so forth . The Bad , Bad , Bad * Required online log in . What ? Are you kidding me ? I have to log in and stay online just to play by myself . I should never have to lag when I am playing alone . A hiccup in internet connection is all it takes to die . If that happens in hardcore , oh that is no good at all . * No voice chat function . That makes no sense at all . Valve has succeeded and made it a standard . It makes absolute no sense to force players to use the in - game text chat or other external programs like skype and ventrilo . Shame on Blizzard . * The additional modes are not appealing . After you finish the game once , you enter Nightmare mode , and so forth . However , aside from higher difficulty , different items , and tougher monsters , there is really no difference . The same thing , again and again . * I expected the graphics to be much better and refined . Zoomed in , the game just looks horrible and blocky . I had a wonderful and enjoyable time finishing the game first time through . After that , I began to mope around and wander around trying to find some reason to keep playing the game . So I tried selling armor and weapon . I purchased armor and weapons from the auctions . I wanted to improve my hero ' s overall makeup . Then , that got old . I officially stopped playing after a month . Disappointing . There is little to no replay value .\n",

If the servers are down you cannot play , if you lose or do not have a constant internet connection you cannot play the game you just paid 60 dollars for and there is no excuse for that . . . . it ' s beyond stupid and ignorant to the players . As a game this is a classic and for me a great addition to the series with amazing new and classic moments , but again the always on DRM is it ' s ruination . Due to DRM In a few years when this is no longer profitable to Blizzard and they shut down the servers you can never play your game again which is total BS and a waste of money , if they are doing that crap the game should be free and pay monthly to play it not pay 60 dollars to have a limited play time . I heard they will be releasing an expansion which is sorly needed as the game is kind of short and afterwards there isn ' t much to do other than log in from time to time to slay demons and play through the game again which is fun in itself but gets boring . DRM is disgusting and we as players need to let the game industry know with our wallets that DRM like this is not acceptable . Fix you lag plagued servers or give us offline mode .

I mean could we even call it a Blizzard game without 12 - year - old WoW style spamming ? Drops Mostly Worthless - After spending hours and hours , I finally got a lvl 61 item that was kinda good , but not reallyWhy Roll Melee - Ranged does incredibly more damage and doesn ' t get their face smashed in constantly , though they get one - shotted which is just as frustratingAuction House Oriented - Breaks game , pvp ladder , etc will be governed by thisPay to Win - Really ? Is there no real gamers out there anymore ? Yes , of course there are , but they won ' t be playing Diablo 3Created Korean Jobs - We ' ll see if Korea ' s new anti - Blizzard law sticks .

Skill System overly - simplified - No sacrifices , no stats , no choices other than picking 1 of 20 lame skills with several variations . . . yawnDesigned for grandkids - grandma ' s - unfortunately this WoW - like approach ruined it for the rest of us by over - simplifying everything10 Years Development - Was this an intern job or something ? Honestly , why did this third - rate game take that long ?

Diablo ' s a Girl - Sorry it needed to be saidGreed before Players - The formula executives have found to maximize profits and literally kill the true gaming experience . Bravo ! Punished for Grouping - They kinda fixed this by removing monster damage bonus , but MF ? Max Level Already ? - Too fast . No sense of accomplishmentHardcore Literally Impossible - Self explanatoryFarming lacks purpose - You need the best gear to farm . So when you finally can farm , you already have the best gear , so what ' s the point ? Glorified Zygna Game - All the sheople will keep the money coming inCMs Troll Forums - Seems they are always justifying their design flaws , as if the RMAH wasn ' t the reason for them in the first placeInflated AH Prices - This is probably due to the prepubescent mentality of most players ' greedCamera Angle Fixed - Why ? Oh , it ' s not gaming atmosphere , but maximizing RMAH profits . Okay okay okay , I think I finally got itGraphics Washed Out - Titan Quest had better graphics 6 years ago , but pre - generation graphics seems to be Blizzard ' s battle cry so I guess that was expectedLack of Servers - Another method of maximizing profits at the expense of their customers again . Worst Gaming - Launch Ever - Only to be surpassed by their next gaming launchCraft System Broken - Too expensive to justify any of the crap it poos out on youIsn ' t Diablo 3 - It ' s a wolf in Diablo ' s clothing . The original Diablo ' s weren ' t designed around the AHGreed Greed Greed - I find it insulting that every aspect of this game leads me to the RMAH in another attempt to take more money from me . Game isn ' t Fixable - The inescapable flaw of this game is it ' s not broken . Truly it ' s working as intended when it frustrates you into the RMAH . The sad Truth - Anyone who says otherwise from anything written above is selling something . Sorry , but it ' s the truth . You ' re not going to make very much money on this game ( most people are looking for a game to play , not a job ) . It is not Diablo 3 . List too Big - This list is just too BIG . Pick any 10 and it would be more than enough to make me move on . There are plenty of games made for \" true gamers \" to spend your time on . * On a side note : Torchlight 2 appears to be the real successor to the Diablo franchise . I ' m not promoting Torchlight 2 in any way as it appears to have cons as well ( kiddie graphics ) , but at least it ' s made by the original Diablo makers and doesn ' t have most of the above problems associated with greed . They deserve some credit for that regardless how their game turns out .\n",

      "Example 0: I played this game through inferno level . I wanted to give the game a fair shot and allow Blizzard to patch the problems that exist . I also was an early Beta participant . Now after weeks of playing the game , I simply wish I had not invested the time or the money in this game . I think the best way to describe this game is in terms of generalities . Listing too many specific instances doesn ' t give the reader a since of my frustration or disappointment . So here goes : The patches they had added don ' t address the real issues and sometimes make the game even less fun . The game appears to not have been tested much at all for inferno levels . The game looses its fun factor extremely fast once you hit inferno . Legendary gear is completely worthless . All the fun affixes that Diablo 2 had are replaced by utterly boring and worthless affixes . You don ' t feel more powerful as you reach high levels . Grinding gear is slow , painful , and boring for inferno . The voice over acting is horrible . The plot line is thin . The character lines are cheesy , cliche ridden garbage that try to be funny but aren ' t . Makes the game feel like it was made for a 10 year old . Bottom line is this . After playing Diablo 3 , I decided Diablo 2 was far and away a better game and reinstalled it rather than continue playing Diablo 3 . Completely dissapointed after waiting 10 + years .\n",

      "Example 0: It ' s a dark and dreary day outside here in MD and it ' s just perfect for this game . Yes , I had some of the problems that others had getting into the game and yes Blizzard , requiring a constant internet connection to play DOES INDEED SUCK , but it ' s the first day of launch and one of the most anticipated PC games since the LAST Starcraft game is back to suck time out of our hands once again . I remember getting a hold of Diablo II back in 2002 to play while I was out sick and it dominated my life for nearly 4 months and in that time , I had to upgrade my PC twice so that it would run properly . This time I was prepared and so far , so good . Thank you Blizzard for doing the same as you did with Starcraft and making this installable on both a Mac and a PC as I had no problems installing on either but again , requiring one to be online to play single player was not a good idea ! EDIT : Diablo III : Is the trip back to hell worth it ? So after 2 - 3 hrs of waiting for the servers to go online , an hr of phone time with Verizon to reset my internet connection and finally putting four or five hrs in , here is where we stand : Issue # 1 : Blizzard really dropped the ball on the server issue . While I had no probs getting on very early yesterday , when I came home yesterday afternoon , the servers were down for at least 2 - 3 hrs ( which gave me some time to play Max Payne which is a game that reminds me soooo much of Stranglehold which came out in 2007 ) and trying to log in a few times got so bad , that I actually had to call Verizon to have them reboot and refresh our routers from outside . Finally around 6pm I got on and played until around 11pmIssue # 2 : No way in hell ( hehe . . . see what I did there ? ) should this be an online only game to play . I get the idea considering how bad Diablo II was abused but there is no reason with the server issues that they had should a game like this require a constant internet connection just to play . And it really sucks that there is no LAN option similar to what Diablo II had . The game itself : After playing so many of the clones like Scared I and II , Titan Quest ( one of the best clones ) and a few forgettable others , I was glad to say that this was worth the wait . Yeah this game plays akin to a FTP MMORPG but without all of the hassle . Your game is instanced which means you or whomever else you allow in run that instance and you don ' t have mobs of people to share a game world with . Graphically , it ' s not phenomenal or mind blowing but on both my PC and my wife ' s iMac the game is running at full tilt although her machine has the option of running it at max res of 2550 x 1600 which makes it a little more crisp . However , the environments are dark and creepy , not bright , cartoony and Fable - ish like what some feared would happen . I got no lag time when lots of monster crowded the screen and I was impressed by some of the lighting SFX . The one small complaint I have on the graphics is that most of the time you are outdoors , there is this ' fog ' that takes away a lot of the detail of the game but ones you go inside not so much . Also because it ' s an isometric view , you really can ' t scroll in close to see a lot of the details , but what is cool is the gore fest that you get ; eviscerations , decapitations and so forth to ensure that you are playing the right game and it ' s good ! Control - wise , I still feel like I need to calibrate my mouse a bit because sometimes I feel like I am moving although I want to shoot and vice - versa but thankfully it ' s compact and you aren ' t made to feel like you need to learn a lot of buttons to play it . But game wise ? It ' s DIABLO plain and simple . It ' s dark and dreary with plenty to kill . What i really like and loathe simultaneously is that surprisingly there are a lot of environmental pieces that are destructible such as walls , tables , bannisters and so on but the problem is even though you can use some of these as traps to kill monsters , it doesn ' t affect you or your companion , which for a game like this is a bit cheap but oh well . Loot drops are plentiful and I don ' t know if it ' s me but in Diablo II , I don ' t remember finding as much magical stuff so frequently as I have thus far . My stash is mostly full with stuff I may be able to use and because now I have the blacksmith available , I can break down some of the junk and build better weapons but as soon as I get my 14K of gold , I am buying more stash room ! And that is the other thing , you can and will accumulate gold very rapidly so no worries about being able to eventually buying a \" Sword of Thrashing \" for 5k because in less than 2 hrs you can afford it ! Now while people will probably criticize the new leveling system , I like it . Once I level up , all I need to do is go in , activate the new skill , see if I like my new skill as opposed to my old skill and K . I . M . No need to fol around for an hr , trying to figure out where to put your points because it ' s done for you . At first I didn ' t like it but after 2 hrs , I was like let me hurry and get my Demon Hunter leveled so I can hurry up and continue ! And how unfortunate was I that the server went down for maintenance the MOMENT I made it to the Skeleton King ? Besides it was 11pm and I needed to go to bed but that old feeling of ' just one more dungeon ' had crept back in like days of old with Diablo II . Blizzard did a good job of recreating that dangling the carrot feel that I haven ' t had since 2003 and I have no idea if they put crack into these games or what but few other games had me as hooked as Diablo II and so far no one has recreated its success . However , Blizzard needs to seriously fix the server issue because the forums have be lit ablaze by angry gamers who really wanted to get their fix and due to numerous server outages , were unable to do so . it ' s not like Blizzard didn ' t know to expect so many people ; 800 , 000 people in the US alone reserved it and almost 1 . 5 million across the globe . Once they get past this issue and things settle down , I have a feeling that enough people will jump on and play the hell out of this game over and over like we did 10 years ago .\n",

      "Example 0: I ' ll start off by saying that you cannot own this game , it ' s more like a life - time rental for $ 59 without any guarantee that it will work in the future be it two weeks from now or even tomorrow . I was skeptical of all the negative reviews about the always on Internet DRM mechanism but all I can tell is that it works in the player / customer ' s disadvantage . All the negative feedback this game has gotten in just one day speak for itself . Not only this adds 0 resale value but you cannot even play your own copy if the servers go down and I ' m not even referring to online play but even playing the offline campaign requires an active Internet connection .

Constant internet connection should never be required for single player mode and for sixty dollars I should at least have a copy for single player instead of a useless disc I can ' t even use .

I can ' t see myself touching D3 ever again , which is a shame . This game would be a decent arcade game , which is basically what it is . But it has almost no RPG elements , and doesn ' t require any sort of thought . They took out everything that wasn ' t broken in Diablo 2 , or ARPG ' s in general and added a bunch of flavorless , generic , WoW inspired garbage . The only thing that would seperate a wizard from the other million or so wizards is gear . There is no choice when creating your character , everyone is exactly the same . To progress on the higher MP ' s in inferno you need ridiculously good gear , and you are pigeonholed into a couple of different specs per class . I don ' t want to rehash what everyone else has been saying , but for a decent brain - dead time waster it would be worth $ 15 - $ 20 bucks .

Blizzard is tired of the exploits and I don ' t blame them .

Being a Diablo 1 fan originally , this was hard for me to swallow at first , but now I think its for the best . Instead of being childish about being unable to play without online DRM etc , why not invest in ATVI stock and directly benefit for the increased sales as a result of the lack of the ability to pirate the game .

      "Example 0: I thought all the talk about game - killing lag , cartoony graphics and endless errors was probably just a bunch of geeky whiners . Then I actually loaded this piece of trash onto my computer . That ' s when I found out that Blizzard had invented a brand - new feature for single - player games : massive , crippling lag . It ' s a surprising bonus , since you ' ve just spent the last 30 minutes installing untold gigabytes of data onto your computer . Yet somehow , the thing needs to constantly pull data from the Internet - even though there ' s no one in dungeon but you . You click , you wait , you die - often with no idea why . But let ' s assume for a minute that Blizzard figures out its servers eventually and the lag returns to a semi - acceptable level where the game is playable . Then you find out about the errors . Tons of them . Errors that could have been fixed during this game ' s literal decade of development . Yes , you read that correctly , it took more than a decade to create this garbage . Yet you ' ll find constant errors that kick you out of the game , reset your character and shut off your game permanently . Yes , it sounds like it ' s made - up , but it ' s not . For instance , I was lucky enough to encounter an error 316704 ( party error ) which kicked me out of the game and wouldn ' t allow me to return . The confusing part was , I wasn ' t in a party . I was playing a single - player game . Blizzard managed to spend 11 years developing a game that doesn ' t run properly , and isn ' t very fun - even when it ' s not shutting itself down . The fact is , most of these problems could have easily been fixed by not requiring an Internet connection to play an offline game . But that would have been too obvious . Better to be clever and release a game that no one can ever hope to play without losing all their progress to a random blip in cyberspace . When Diablo 3 does run , it ' s mildly amusing , sort of like Torchlight except worse . So if you like that , then you ' ll like this in a few months when the glitches have been dealt with . But I don ' t have the time to waste waiting for my character to catch up to my mouse pointer so I can die by the hand of invisible monsters .

They did indeed have several issues . I am very disappointed with this game . I feel that this is rather not a sequel at all to Diablo 2 . Perhaps it would be an enhanced edition of the first series : Diablo 1 , but not 2 . Its gameplay mechanics and features are not worthy enough to be called a \" sequel \" to the game . I don ' t feel any resemblance to Diablo 2 , but a closer resemblance of Diablo I in this game . Only 4 players are only allowed onto a game . Compared to Diablo 2 , 8 players were allowed . I really don ' t think this game is intended to be a Massive Online RPG if onlya maximum of 4 players are allowed into a game . This is ridiculous . I really do hope that they increase it to at least 6 players because 4 players just feels too few for a MMORPG . For now , don ' t play Diablo 3 . Not when the game is incomplete or half - baked . This game clearly needs re - adjustments before it can be taken seriously by players .

      "Example 0: I ' ve been a fan of Diablo since the first one came out . Diablo III has been on my wish - list since shortly after part 2 was released . Quite frankly , this game is exactly what I ' d expect , and then some . When I play a Diablo game , I expect \" click - and - loot . \" Anything else is extra ! On the previous titles , I ' d make a character , finish the game and maybe tool around for a bit longer . Then I ' d put the game down for a few months , only to come back and do it all over again . This is crypt - crawler ! Not a big RPG or MMORPG . Granted , Blizzard has implemented many of those features into the game , and I ' m grateful , as I like RPG ' s . Here ' s a rundown of certain features and my impressions on them : Sound and Graphics : They ' re great ! The music is exactly what I ' d expect from the series ; creepy and atmospheric . Very well done ! The graphics are perfectly fine for a crypt - crawler . I really like what Blizzard did with the physics . The particles with the fog and what not are also very nice ( the other \" most recent \" title that I ' ve played on my PC was WoW . . . ) No complaints here ! Story : The game is slightly more involved than the previous installments . I like how they gave more quests this time through , and a few more characters as well . I also really like how they keep Cain through out the series ! Again , I think they ' ve improved on this area . The Auction House : I don ' t use it and don ' t care . I ' m not at all surprised or offended that Blizzard decided to go with it , either . I remember that people were buying gear for Diablo 2 on eBay , and let ' s not forget about the gold - farmers in WoW . The \" pay - to - win \" mentality isn ' t Blizzard ' s original evil idea . It ' s been going on for ages , and the fact that they ' re just now cashing in on it shouldn ' t be a shock to anyone . This feature is there for those who don ' t want to wait for the good stuff , and I ' m fine with that . In fact , it ' s a little better in the sense that people won ' t be getting robbed when they make a purchase on eBay ( provided that ' s still possible . . . ) Long - term Play Value and the Challenge of Inferno Mode : As I said , these games come in bursts for me . I ' ll expect to play through it multiple times , though these times will be spaced out . Quite frankly , I don ' t have the time to level each class to 60 and complete the game on \" Inferno \" with each one . In fact , I ' ve never cared much for the super - hard modes in any video game . They ' re exactly what they claim to be ! HARD ! If you ' re a die - hard gamer and need that insane challenge , then you have it . Me ? I just like the story . I ' ll play it on the other modes , and be quite content . The number of complaints on this topic really surprises me . Especially when they ' re from people who claim that they ' re old - school Diablo fans . Remember the ladder mode on Diablo 2 ? You get exactly one life . If you die , that character is gone . For good . But , regardless of what I think , Blizzard seems to be listening to the complaints , and easing up on it . Before long , the Inferno mode will be a moderate increase in challenge when compared to the mode before it , and those who managed to complete the game in Inferno pre - nerf will be awarded with some special achievement . Folks should keep in mind that all Blizzard titles are a work - in - progress , through the duration of their life . I think I last tried Diablo 2 back around 2008 , and it even had some fairly recent work done on it . This game will be around for a while , and will probably keep changing . Pick it back up in a month or two , and I bet things will be different ! Required Internet Connection : This was kinda dumb . Though it doesn ' t affect me , I don ' t like the idea in principle . This is the opposite of what I ' d expect from Blizzard . I might actually knock off a star in the review , but I feel enough people have been unduly harsh . Overall Verdict : I really enjoy the game , and I ' m glad that I finally got the opportunity to play it ! For those who are fans of the dungeon - crawling genre , this should please you . For those who are expecting something else , well . . . you ' ll be disappointed .\n",

      "Example 0: To me this is just a shoot them up game . The graphics are very good but limited and there is very little color . Very drab except when fighting , which I must admit most of the time . Almost all encounters are indoors somewhere so your always on some kind of trail . Frankly the auction house is not even worth my time if you have half a brain you can get gear that will take you though all levels as you travel . The story line is good but limited , very little free play and hardly any quests . This is not a wander around game questing and having a little fun , its pretty much all fighting . Follow the story line , kill the monsters , do a little gem crafting make some armor and your done . When started made 4 toons took one up to higher levels and not even going to do the others unless I ' m really bored . The old diablo if I recall correctly had more variation and more quests . Having trouble getting motivated about pony level even . Other than the graphics and the fights its not really much of a game especially after waiting what 5 , six years ? ? I guess like everyone else blizz is all about the money , no pay to play so the game is so so .\n",

      "Example 0: This review is strictly for the Digital Rights Management portion of the game that requires you to ALWAYS have an internet connection to play even SINGLE PLAYER . I have always been a big fan of Diablo . I have had two copies of this game on pre - order for over a year . Just before going to get them , I started reading the stories of the servers crashing and players becoming frustrated because they could not play single player . Looking further into it , I saw that it was because Blizzard , FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER in a Diablo game , requires you to ALWAYS be connected to their servers in order to play . This means that if the server is down , you can ' t play . If you don ' t have an internet connection , you can ' t play . If they ever decide to shut down the servers , you can ' t play ever again . You have a $ 60 piece of software that is useless . I cancelled my pre - orders and refuse to ever purchase this or any other game ( that isn ' t an MMO ) that has this kind of DRM . I really wish everyone would take a stand against this . It doesn ' t matter how awesome a game may be , if you can ' t play it , what good is it ?\n",

      "Example 0: First off , this game has nowhere near the armor and weapon selection D2 has . D2 is superior to this game in every way . D3 has no LAN support and does not allow players to even play the single player game without being logged into Battlenet . By the way , you must have broadband . Despite 12 years of development , D3 is full of bugs and subpar graphics . The music is nothing special also . What a shame Activision has ruined Blizzard and turned the company into a greedy scam artist . Blizzard has turned its back on gamers and is only interested in bleeding us dry . Do yourself a favor and stay away from this game . D1 and D2 are much more fun !\n",

      "Example 0: So this is my first Diablo game i have played and after playing Diablo 3 i realize i made a mistake in buying this game . So my first problem with the game is its just point in click , like its still 1999 . You are pretty much forced to play the game with just the mouse , pretty much as long you have a hand and 2 fingers you will do fine . I would have liked the game set to modern standards , as in full 3D behind the shoulder camera not over the top and proper controls . My second problem is you have to be online to play single player . Which i understand cause it prevents people hacking and cheating and selling items on the AH but at the same time i shouldnt be forced to play online to play a singleplayer game . Heck many times i lag cause Blizzard servers suck . My third problem is the game gets boring fast , So on my first playthough it was fun , i took my time finished it at around 25 hours , so then i have to play on nightmare mode doing the same thing as normal mode but harder monsters , and then repeat on hell mode and repeat on inferno . Now once you get to inferno you have to grind for HOURS AND HOURS to get by , Once you complete act 1 inferno , you need to grind for 20 - 50 hours JUST to gear up and stand a chance in Act 2 Inferno . Its boring doing the same old thing over and over and over . My forth problem is that , game has been out for nearly a month YET its Auction house is still not working right . Not only that we were suppose to have Real money Auction house on the 22nd of may and still dont have it . My fifth problem is , like MMOs , the game has to have server maintenance of 6 - 8 hour downtime . Never have i played a \" single player game \" where i have to deal with weekly 8 hour maintenance . Lastly my sixth problem is HACKS . A lot of people are getting hacked left and right . Why ? I dont know . Never have i played a game with so many people getting hacked . Nice security blizzard has . Even with the authenticator people are still getting hacked . Overall this really isnt a good game . While it was fun for a while , its just a boring grind now .\n",

      "Example 0: At first all I saw was red health bars everywhere I looked , so I disabled them . Then damage numbers burnt images into my vision ; had to disable those too . Needless to say , it can be fun to grind eq hoping for that small gain in power , but it ' s VERY repetitive grinding the same areas over and over and crafting LOTS of times to get something decent ( which requires grinding for resources ) . Blizzard did a lot of work revamping this game and many improvements were made ( I added 2 stars as a result ) . The eq is among the best in gaming and requires math , research , and testing to make it work with the huge variety of skills / ways to play your character . Unfortunately the work they did was to finish the game , which was only mediocre when released . This work requires pay , which will come from buying the game ( again ) to play as ' reaper of souls ' which has more areas to grind and another character class people seem excited about . The game is simply not good enough to buy twice . Wait for a GOTY or package deal and don ' t pay more than current value for 1 game ( around $ 60 ) . Publishers need to learn that when consumers make a purchase , they expect a finished game instead of being double charged and having to roll with the punches of massive game changing patches which render some of your previous efforts a waste .\n",

      "Example 0: I waited to buy this game because of all the launch issues it was having . After a week or two my friends really wanted me to go get it . So I strolled down to the local gamestop and bought the download . I was really stoked to play it . My friends and I played on easy and after act 1 i just got bored of it . My guy is level 15 an I have stopped playing . I honestly want to return it . The story didn ' t grasp my attention at all . I felt like I spent half of my time getting the best items and not playing the game . I also am disappointed there is no multiplayer my friend said they were making it . My question is why didn ' t it come out when the game was released . It ' s like releasing a not complete game , ( like mw3 ) . People in south korea got to return the game why can ' t we ? Also playing on ultra settings wasn ' t very impressive , i don ' t know I guess i ' m more of a cod / bf3 graphic guy . For now I ' ll stick to Starcraft II , way better game . Another note : The game took 12 gigs which isn ' t much for the average pc gamer but when your solid state disk has 30 gigs left its a lot . I moved it over to my other hard drive that has 1 TB of space so in other words its trash .\n",

      "Example 0: The game is fine for a first walkthrough , you will get about 30 - 50 hours of a good expirience , the problem is that when you get games as DIABLO 3 , you do it for it to last years , not some 30 hours .

      "Example 0: Do not buy this game . I would rather play pac man . I am a hardcore fan of the Diablo series and it is clear that Blizzard made horrible decisions in the production of this game . 1 ) Online Only Play2 ) Only 4 People can Play Together instead of 8 in Diablo 23 ) Every Character will have Every Spell in Equal Amounts . I feel like a Marxist created this game . I have no desire to recreate a character to give him different abilities , skill points , and vitality / strength / dexterity / intelligence points because everyone has the same everything if you are the same class ! This means PVP will be solely based on items , and possibly skill selection . And everyone will use the same skills most likely in PVP . I watched a Blizzard developer in an interview basically say that they had a hard time balancing skill point development so they just got rid of it . Yeah well they ruined the game in part due to that . 4 ) The storyline is a saturday morning cartoon , but less entertaininng . The voiceovers are horrible . Characters do not even move their lips in movies when they talk , or if they do it is hardly noticeable . 5 ) Questing is like someone is holding your hand . The minimap pings where you need to go . Every quest is basically \" find this location or person \" . And there is nothing unique about it . You do not have to match symbols on a wall like in the old Diablo 2 Act 2 or get a horadric cube to make a staff or ANYTHING . It is so cheap and dumbed down . Basically the whole game feels like a boss fight . CLICK CLICK CLICK . 5 ) The auction house idea was horrible . Now players willing to give blizzard more money are basically the winners and the people actually playing to find items will suffer . 6 ) The Monk is overpowered and the Barbarian sucks ( I am level 33 ) . 7 ) There are not enough classes . 8 ) Every act is monotonous boring . CLICK CLICK CLICK . The game as a whole is not that long though . 9 ) Online only play and no LAN play10 ) Some Monsters are taken directly out of WoW . That is just a short list , but you get the idea . I have not even mentioned the fact that in the first 2 - 3 days the servers have been down half the time . So much for that stress test or beta being any help . This game basically feels like I am repeating 5 quests on WoW 8 hours at a time to complete an Act . Koreans are beating this game in under 2 hours . Ever since Blizzard screwed up SC2 ( fast paced click fest now ) I have questioned how they just remake a game , but screw it up and call it a sequel . The old blizz developers are off working for new companies . If Blizzard were smart they would bring them all back . There was so much more depth in Diablo 2 , and even Diablo 1 . There are no meta games in Diablo 3 . I could teach a chimpanzee to play this game . The quests just really ruined it for me . I feel like I am playing a cartoon dumbed down version of Diablo 2 . Do not even buy this for the novelty because there is none . I will play this for one week at most and then I will probably never play it again .\n",

( I have the collector ' s edition which is why I don ' t show up as a ' verified purchase ' ) THE GOOD : = = = = = = = = = 1 . Fun to playIt ' s still fun to play , although it is still the same mindless , hack and slash , quasi - RPG game that the previous two are . 2 . Decent presentationGraphics and sound ( music / sound effects / etc ) are pretty solid , if uninspired . 3 . Isometric viewI am really glad that they did not turn this game into a first person view game , like Bethesda did with Fallout 3 . THE BAD = = = = = = = 1 . Server \" issues \" ' Nuff said . Surprising given that it took Blizzard 12 years to come out with this game . 2 . Quasi - RPG , with NO CHARACTER BUILDS / CUSTOMIZATION ( i . e . LITTLE REPLAY VALUE ) Nothing is permanent , including character ' development ' . By choosing to not allow players to increase specific character attributes ( dexterity , strenth , etc . ) , Blizzard really took out the \" quasi \" in \" quasi - RPG \" . It ' s actually a straight up action game , with skills automatically unlocked automatically based on XP the SAME FOR EVERYONE . So absolutely ZERO character customizations . Forget about agonizing over how to develop your character , because Blizzard has decided to dumb it down for you and make everything possible at any time . Don ' t like your current skills ? Well , just choose another one , they ' re all available after all ! Ridiculous decision and quite possibly the worst thing about this game . 3 . Complete Re - hash of Diablo II ( i . e . NOT VERY INTERESTING TO PLAY THE FIRST TIME ) This game is basically D2 with updated graphics and worse voice acting and absolutely zero atmostphere . The maps seem so familiar that you could probably do the entire game from memory even if you have never played it before , as long as you have played D2 . Specifically . . . 4 . Lack of Randomized dungeons ( i . e . LOW REPLAY VALUE ) Everything is in the same location , or so it seems at least . The continental maps are the same , so everytime you play a game online you join the mad rush of players all running towards destinations like rats who have mastered a maze . The ' dungeons ' ( there are actually few dungeons ) , or locations , all seem to be minimally varied at all game to game . This makes the game lose a lot of its REPLAY VALUE . Let ' s say that this game has very low replay value unless you want to play all the characters through all the difficulty levels and get them all up to level 60 or whatever the highest level is . No point in ever playing the same class twice , since there is no ' build ' anymore for characters . 5 . Lack of AtmosphereIt really looks like WoW in an isometric view . Completely gone is the claustrophobic , disturbing , and foreboding atmosphere of D1 . Everything looks cartoonish , which is exacerbated by the veritable fireworks display of all colors everytime you use just about any skill . Not to mention that many weapons have a neon glow to them even when not in use . Don ' t be surprised to see a barbarian running around with bright neon orange and green axes in his hands . And a coop battle looks like you ' re at some kind of a rave or Phish concert . 6 . MiscellaneousBad writing , distracting attempts at humor , very poor voice acting ( especially Leah ) , and tedious intro / cutscenes .

Add a few new \" goods \" and \" bads \" for this game . . . GOOD = = = = 1 . Better CutscenesThe ones at the end are better than the earlier ones ( e . g . it ' s possible to watch it through without hitting ESC ) . 2 . Still Fun ( for now . . . ) Yes , it is still fun to play , despite the numerous deficiencies mentioned previously . Once I finish the game on the hardest difficulty , I cannot imagine playing it again until the inevitable expansion pack ( s ) comes out . I will play all the difficulty levels though and the expansion packs , which should say something about the casual playability of this game . Despite the limitations on and simplification of character development , it is still fun to ' unlock ' new skills to use . Much of the fun does derive from leveling ( read : grinding ) and item collection ( who doesn ' t still love to collect rare , unique , and now legendary items ? ) . BAD = = = 1 . Too SHORT ! ! ! ( i . e . LOW REPLAY VALUE ) Maybe 15 - 20 hours and I finished the game in normal difficulty , and I cannot believe how SHORT THIS GAME IS . It ' s shocking actually , and it does not help that the acts are so similar to D2 . For some reason I expected this game to be much longer and expansive compared with D2 , similar to how D2 was much more immense in scope compared with D1 . But no , there are still just 4 ( I think ) acts that are fairly short and easy to complete . 2 . Lame Bosses / Lairs ( i . e . Zzzzzz . . . ) Most of the bosses in D3 are pretty lame . Half of them are just gigantic , bulbous and obese monstrosities that are barely distinguishable from one another . Only Diablo himself appears significantly unique . The lairs are similarly boring . . . most are just gigantic square rooms that you run around endlessly trying to avoid getting injured . The boss action , of course , is pure ' grinding ' at its finest . In the later acts , the bosses are almost back to back to back , which to be quite honest got tired really fast , especially when they all seemed the same . 3 . Horrible Skill Interface / System ( i . e . FORGET ABOUT SWITCHING THEM IN A BATTLE ! ) Yes , the way that you switch between skills is very cumbersome and involves opening up a skills window and then clicking on various tabs to select different skills and their runes ( which are not physical items either ) that was not intuitive at all at the beginning , and even when you get used to it still prevents easy switching of skills . Fine , let there be a ' cool off ' time for switching skills , but requiring the skills window to open up in order to change skills is beyond annoying and really means you ' re not likely to do it in a battle . So , that means that essentially you ' re stuck with a half dozen skills , max , at any given time . This feels very limited and boring , especially when you have all these skills that you unlocked and would like to use with some variety to keep things fun . 4 . Linear Gameplay ( i . e . GO FROM A > B > C > D . . . ) More so than D1 or even D2 , D3 is super linear . There is very little exploration you can do except for on the world maps , and even then there are blockades that need to be unlocked as part of some quest or another , limited your ability to explore . OVERALL = = = = = = = It is still a fun game but very disappointing in many ways . Primarily the lack of character attribute / skill customization ( e . g . no ' builds ' ) , the sense of deja vu that you get when you play due to the game being so similar in design to Diablo 2 , and the small scope of the game . I couldn ' t believe that Diablo came so soon , and when he died I was wondering if there would be another act or something , but alas , it just ended with a whimper and yet another cutscene . 3 / 5 for mindless fun2 / 5 for overall quality of the game * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ( UPDATED ( 5 / 20 / 2012 ) * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * BOTTOM LINE = = = = = = = = = = = So , I got my character up to level 50 and finished D3 on nightmare difficulty and . . . I just uninstalled it . The truth is , the more you play , the higher level you achieve , the less you want to continue playing . This mostly is a result of the lack of character development / customization ( and by that , I mean inability to assign attribute points or selectively develop / specialize skills as in D2 ) and the overall similarity to D2 . The over - simplication ( and let ' s not forget that D2 was a pretty simple game to begin with . . . hardly real RPG type character development or gameplay ) really is the downfall of this otherwise serviceable game . The bottom line is - - it ' s just not that fun to play over and over again . It ' s also laughable that Blizzard is trying to squeeze even more money out of their fans pockets with the Auction House , which no normal person would ( or could ) actually use to try to make money off of the game . I remember selling various items from D2 on ebay ( remember the ' grandfather sword ' anyone ? ) but it ' s hard to imagine that anyone would do the same with this game . In the end , I have to say that while fun for awhile , D3 is ultimately a massive disappointment to fans of the series . For me , it provided less than a week of gameplay , unlike D2 that I played for months and months . It is not the kind of Blizzard product that the company built its reputation on during the 1990s and 2000s , and is clearly showing the unfortunate influence of big company marketing in the development of one of its most popular franchises . Unless the direction that Blizzard takes with their games ( e . g . dumbing down and simplifying their games to achieve more widespread appeal ) changes , I will NOT be buying another Blizzard product ever . Thank God for Kickstart , which has brought back the possibility of independent game development back from the dead ( Wasteland 2 ! ! ! ) . . .

So , I have the collector ' s edition ( completely worth the $ 100 given all the goodies it comes with ) , which includes D2 / LOD on a USB flash drive . After uninstalling D3 ( after 6 days of gameplay getting my Demon Hunter up to lvl 50 and finishing on nightmare difficulty ) , I decided to see how D2 looked and played ( haven ' t played it since 2001 , after getting the LOD expansion pack ) after all these years . Well , D2 / LOD is still great ! I ' ve been playing for about two weeks ( more than twice the time I played D3 for ) , building a Werebear Druid , and I am amazed with the superiority of this game over the follow - up that took 12 years to be released but feels like a cheap imitation of the real deal . MORE BAD THINGS ABOUT DIABLO 3 = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = 1 . HAND - HOLDING AND DUMBED DOWN GAMEPLAY ( e . g . D3 NEEDS TO APPEAL TO THE TABLET GAMER CROWD ! ! ) Yes , the geniuses at Blizzard decided that D3 had to be super noob friendly to help ensure the most widespread adoption by casual gamers . So , LOOT that drops from monsters for each player in a multiplayer game INDIVIDUALLY , which other players cannot see let alone pickup . I mean , how stupid is that ? It makes no sense for this to happen and is an example of extent of the absurd hand - holding and ' noob - ification ' of this game . Another example is the ELIMINATION of the use of TOWN PORTAL or IDENTIFY scrolls . What a hassle to use those items when Blizzard could just simplify the game to get rid of them , and instead allow players to press a button at any time to magically teleport themselves back to town ( complete with a silly animation of the players crouching and white energy balls emanating from their hands ) , right ? And identify scrolls , a RPG staple from the earliest days , well , why not get rid of that silly hassle too and allow players to identify any item just by right clicking on it ? Frustrated by having to explore the square continental MAPS searching for important locations ( well , the first time you play through that is , because those locations don ' t appear to ever change ) ? Well , no problem because the good folks at Blizzard have decided that exploration is a waste of time and so they make ARROWS and other indicators appear on the map that SHOW YOU WHERE TO GO , and if you are close to an important place . Yes D2 act 1 had a road that would lead you to adjacent maps , but nothing even close to this level of hand - holding . Can anyone really question the noob - ification and extreme linearness of this game ? There ' s not even an option to turn those map ' hints ' / guides off . Yet another example is the noob - ification of the GEAR REPAIR / durability system . In D3 , items have a durability rating ( e . g . 24 / 24 ) but that never seems to decrease ( or at least , very slowly ) , despite using your weapons and taking damage . Even if an item does break you can simply get it FIXED by the blacksmith guy , so really what was the point ? In D2 ( and other RPGs ) , you fix your gear so that it doesn ' t break because typically you can ' t just weld a broken sword back together again ! And of course , don ' t forget that monsters now drop HEALTH ORBS that raise your life instantly when you walk over them , instead of health potions that needed to be then be consumed in order to get healed . So , yes - - Diablo 3 has been SIMPLIFIED and DUMBED DOWN to the level of an arcade side shooter game . Hell , it ' s basically Sonic the Hedgehog with gear grinding ! 2 . ABSURD STORYBy now most Diablo fans have heard about the absurd and cringe - inducing story of D3 ( I won ' t ' spoil ' it for those of you who haven ' t played it yet , but it involves a human and a certain demon mating and producing a very annoying NPC ) . D2 , on the other hand , had a reasonably interesting and fairly well thought out ( if not particularly original ) story of the ' Dark Wanderer ' ( your character from D1 ) , which provides the backdrop for D2 . And don ' t even get me started on the most ridiculous NPC from the Diablo series , Leah . . . 3 . 4 - PLAYER CO - OP LIMITEight player co - op games in D2 are great - - too bad you ' re limited to only four players in D3 . Just stupid . 4 . OTHER BATTLE . NET ISSUESThe game creation system for multiplayer co - op has also been simplified , in a bad way . You can ' t name your games or even play in a game with other players unless you are on the same exact quest . It ' s very limiting and substantially decreases the online replay value ( which is not very high to begin with , unfortunately ) . 5 . SILLY D1 ' BOSS ' CAMEOYes , you ' ve all heard the rumors / spoilers about the return of a Diablo 1 boss ( arguably the most famous and well - liked boss from the Diablo series ) in D3 . No , it makes no sense why this character , who was killed in D1 , would return ( complete with memorable catchphrase ) , but apparently Blizzard thought this would be some sort of a ' treat ' for Diablo fans . It ' s not . 6 . DEMON HUNTER WEARS STILETTO HEELSSeriously ? In hindsight , this probably should have tipped me off as to the quality of the game that I was so eagerly awaiting . CONCLUSION = = = = = = = = = = Don ' t believe all those ' expert ' reviews on the internet , like the mindboggling 100 % rating ( ! ! ) from Joystiq . These online blogs are hardly objective to any degree , due to direct advertising revenue they receive from game companies and / or other perks they may receive ( e . g . being invited to Blizzard headquarters for exclusive sneak peaks , etc . ) that unduly influences their game reviews . In light of this , it is unsurprising that there are so many highly favorable reviews for D3 . This does not obscure the fact that Diablo 3 is simply a mediocre game . Actually , it ' s below average . It gets a 1 star rating from me because of how much worse of a game in many ways ( gameplay , battle . net , etc . ) it is than its predecessor , the great Diablo 2 despite how long it took ( 12 years , holy smokes ! ) to finally come out , and because of Blizzard ' s thinly veiled primary objective of squeezing as much money out of players with the Real Money Auction House - - a feature that detracts from the item finding fun of the game to a significant degree . Bottom line ? Diablo 3 is fun to play . . . for a few days . The problem is that it lacks much of the substance which made Diablo 2 , and even Diablo 1 , so much more engaging to play . . . and play again and again . Perhaps the most accurate description is that D3 is an uninventive and unoriginal reworking of a great game , with deal - breaking noob - ification and over simplifaction of gameplay dynamics and online play . I would recommend waiting for the inevitable , and likely imminent , price drop before picking this one up .\n",

I ' m sorry , but a couple of hours of downtime for the biggest PC game to come out does not justify giving this game 1 or 2 stars . Its a great game , don ' t let the knee jerk reactionaries fool you into thinking its the same as D2 or a watered down RPG : Its solid , will suck your time away , and you ' ll love every minute . Unfortunately , huge releases like this tend to polarize the community because if it isn ' t the digital Jesus that they ' ve been soiling their pants nonstop 12 years for , the nerds go berserk and the result is they give the game a score that they think it DESERVES because every single detail isn ' t EXACTLY the way they want it , versus what it actually is .

All that in the launch and the first week or so of the game is very typical of any \" Blizzard \" game . Anyone who has bought and played any \" Blizzard \" game when the game ( or expansion ) came out knows this .

That being said it was still a fun game to me . I enjoyed the story . I enjoyed the game play . I enjoyed the graphics and \" Lore \" . They did add a lot of content but what I personally think is they need a offline mode like they did for Starcraft 2 , They need to add a bit more to the game like \" PVP \" then it will be a lot better .

      "Example 0: A red flag should go up immediately upon reading the end user license agreement that they make you accept . To paraphrase : We do not guarantee the ability to actually be able to play the game . That tells you all you need to know about the online at all times requirement . In many ways Diablo 3 reminds me of some disappointments I had with Dungeon Siege 3 . There ' s the system that awards a player with every skill by the time a certain level is attained . Gone are the days where you had a stable of characters each with their own specialization . There ' s the system that automatically assigns stat points , another aspect that will be the same every time you play the game . The only way to modify stat points is via item attributes . Levels that are tight corridors . While still fun in their own way all of these things detracted from the replay value of Dungeon Siege 3 . It was a play it a few times game and then forget it because you already knew which skills you ' d end up with and what stats you ' d have before you even started your second playthrough . The exact same ones you had the last time . Diablo 3 suffers the same fate , it ' s not going to last 12 years like its predecessor because there is no depth in character uniqueness . The game is also shorter . Sure , you can play it over again at a higher difficulty but it ' s still disappointing to have to play the exact same levels three times over to arrive at a decent target time for what should have been the time it takes to play through the game once . With the online requirement that perpetually threatens playing time ( and restricts play on my terms ) and a severely shortened replay value I found it difficult to justify the initial price tag . For what it is this game should have been much , much cheaper at launch . I would say wait for a price drop but this is Blizzard . You ' ll be waiting a long time for that . Better to just skip this one and look at other good up and coming action RPG games .\n",

The monsters are always new and fresh every corner you turn a new fun slash and gash of zombies to minotaur . The story line is great and the video story line looks life like . If you are one that is worried about all the errors this game is giving wait a couple of weeks before buying so they can smooth everything out .

      "Example 0: I have been a Blizzard devotee for over 14 years , have purchased every game they ' ve released since then , and attended Blizzcon last year . With Diablo 3 though , it has completely changed how I view the company . Diablo 3 ' s gameplay is very fun and I leveled a witch doctor at midnight on 5 / 15 / 12 . I then realized though my class was severely gimped in inferno to due pets dying instantly . I have since then leveled a 60 of every class in the game and got a hardcore character to 52 ( died due to a server hiccup on Blizzard ' s server ) . With that said , the future aspects of the game were poorly designed and even the developers don ' t know what they ' re doing . After grudging through the poor story three times in normal , nightmare and hell difficulties , you ' re met with inferno . Blizzard wanted to add an \" end game \" feel to Diablo 3 and made this difficulty what they call \" hard \" by making you one - shot every time and coming up with almost invulnerable champion combinations . I can take a major difficulty like this if I am rewarded for it after defeating them . In Diablo 3 though , the loot is so random that even if you did receive the top tier ilvl 63 item , it ' s likely - hood of being a complete dud is very high . After doing this for a couple of weeks and not finding any upgrades , I was absolutely done with the game . The major way you ' ll receive upgrades in this game is buy collecting gold / using real world money and buying items off their auction house , which leads me to my major complaint . Last week I decided to sell off all of my items and quit the game since it ' s not fun at all anymore ( unlike Diablo 2 , which was fun for over five years for me ) . In the process , I sold my items in Blizzard ' s RMAH . All of my items sold , but I never received the funds for one of my items . After six days , I contacted Blizzard ' s CSR reps and was told he / she say the auction failed and asked me what I saw on my screen . My AH screen said the item had sold , processed and completed and I didn ' t have the item anymore . When I replied , another CSR replied back and responded to me as if I was using the gold AH and told me they cannot recover any items and they cannot proceed with any action . I was FURIOUS that I was being brushed off like that when it was involving real money that Blizzard now owes me . I once again replied letting them know that this is real money we ' re speaking about and how I wasn ' t going to let them just drop me like that . I let them know I am contacting the BBB and for the CSR rep to have a beer on me . . . literally . Another CSR rep responded and told me to give it more time and see if the funds are deposited later in the week . So , I ' ve waited their 3 - 5 days they say it can take in extreme cases to receive my funds , and now they ' re telling me to wait longer . I will wait another week , but I have lost all faith in Blizzard and will never purchase another Blizzard game . It saddens me that a game I had been waiting for seven years has completely destroyed how I feel about Blizzard . Thanks Blizzard , it was a fun 14 years . Update 8 / 2 / 2012Still haven ' t received the money from my one auction . I have since contacted the BBB and filed a complaint against Blizzard Entertainment . Beware of the RMAH .\n",

My first complaints about the game still stand , and yes , Blizzard does have Server Lag issues during peak hours of gameplay as other gamers have pointed out . However , after several hours of gameplay I still find myself drawn back in . NPC Monsters progress in toughness as your character levels up , so you can continue to gain experience and loot in low level dungeons even as a high level character - making revisiting favorite locations worthwhile . The soundtrack is every bit as memorable as that of the first 2 installments of the series ( maybe even more so ) . Even the forced top - down perspective mode of gameplay , which most people would agree is outdated , does not deter from the addictiveness of the gameplay . D3 is a fast paced hack - n - slash game with all the trappings of its predecessors .

Those familiar with the Diablo series and its gameplay will feel right at home with this title . I am disappointed with the art direction , however , which makes the game feel more like a top - down perspective expansion of World of Warcraft and less like the gritty Gothic ambiance of the original Diablo titles . The lack of a skill tree and lack of character customization is also a disappointment , as each character you create will be exactly like other player characters of the same class . That being said , this is a great game for those of us who are suckers for nostalgia and simply want a visceral Hack - n - Slash with which to kill 15 - 20 minutes at a time - complete with the \" slurpy \" , \" steely \" and \" crunching \" sounds we ' ve come to expect every time a weapon is swung in the Diablo universe . : ) Overall , well worth the $ 20 I paid for it and I do expect to download the Expansions as they become available .

      "Example 0: I played this game for close to 200 hours in a failed attempt to get some fun out of it . Yes , you ' re going to think that I got 200 hours of enjoyment out of it , but no I didn ' t . I kept reading that if I get to X section or X level or X difficulty or X gear that the game comes alive . 700 days played in World of Warcraft . Thousands of hours played in D2 . Having played many Blizzard games I kept giving this trash the benefit of the doubt but finally realized it was nothing but Blizzard fan boys talking and quit . I believed in Blizzard Entertainment . I really , really did . From the start the game is doomed as the story has more holes than a block of Swiss cheese . Then you ' re expected to play the game in a group where one guy always clicks skip story . Playing solo is futile as your gear drops will be for another class , thus you need different classes in your group to share the loot . Sounds pretty stupid right ? It is trust me . What if the other guy in the group doesn ' t want to share ? You get nothing . Fun huh ? So at this point you ' re stuck buying gear off the auction house for either millions of gold or real money . This game is all about the fun of looking on the auction house for gear to beat a level . Pure fail Blizzard ! Pure fail ! Then there are issues with the game ' s difficulty as it makes you play the game out on beyond easy mode where I lost 3 friends to boredom . They refused to finish the first difficulty as they literally danced in the fire , intentionally got hit , and never died . They said the game was crap and quit . The game doesn ' t get decent until the 3rd time you ' ve played it through . So you have to play the exact same game 3 times before you get a challenge unless you fall asleep at the keyboard from boredom and die . If you get to a section you can ' t get past just buy some gear off the auction house and more than likely you ' re back to god mode again . Last point I want to touch on is that the game ' s end game is nonexistent . As in it ' s hard not because it ' s fun , but because it cheeses you into death . I play a Demon Hunter and most everything can one shot you unless you invested hundreds of million in gold into your gear . Then you can last for 3 hits ! So assume you ' re not the type of person to spend real money on the auction house . So you ' re going to get a ton of one hit deaths when you try to kill elite mobs . You might die 9 times to a mob if you ' re not spending real money on gear . Repair bill will be close to 50 , 000 gold . The mob will drop about 3 , 000 gold in items and money . So then you get in a group and pray that the mob decides to chase another person . But there are tons more of them so you still die over and over . Sounds like fun huh ? Who thought mechanics that can one shot kill you were fun ? I also want to mention that the game lags like no other . Take the one shot mechanics from the aforementioned paragraph and sprinkle in some huge lag spikes and you can watch your characters die over and over to invisible mobs , invisible attacks , melee mobs hitting you clean across your screen , etc . And there is a Hardcore mode where if you die you lose your character and all of it ' s gear . That makes the game even more fun with lag ! Game is terrible . Leave it in the store . Do not buy . It is not fun in the slightest when you get to Inferno . The story is terrible . The gear drops don ' t exist for you . The auction house is the best place to level up . And the real money auction house has the best gear . Enough said . : )\n",

      "Example 0: The game is decently fun and brings back some memories of the first two , which I played over and over for hours upon end . The game play lacks the challenge and death penalties of the previous ones , but every game seems to be going that way , so I can ' t fault Blizzard too much on that as not every gamer is a hardcore gamer these days . I have no complaints even about the DRM scheme as I ' d much rather just be online ( like I am 100 % of the time anyway ) then have some random DRM software installed on my machine . I ' ll even let it slide that the physical DVD only contained a tiny . exe that just launches the downloader instead of having any content on it , as I got a cool stationary pad in the box ; ) The bad part though , is I have no clue how long I ' ve spent actually installing this game . Then after today , patching was a nightmare of the same problem . Whatever torrent scheme they have running just seems to constantly fail at what it is doing or something . It took hours to get to a point where I could actually download the files to play the game . This was only accomplished by : 1 ) Downloading the blizzard agent / launcher from a 3rd party site and installing them manually by running it on a newly created windows user account on my computer that did not run as administrator3 ) Switch that account to an administrator4 ) Run the actual installer that was finally downloaded5 ) Once downloaded , kill the installer / launcher / agent manually from task manager6 ) Switch back to my normal user account and finally play itIt even sounds confusing to me when I go back and re - read it . A normal ( not tech savy ) user would never be able to do this with instructions , much less figure it out on their own . Is the game fun ? Sure , I like it . Would I have bought it if I had any inkling of what it would take to get it installed / running / patched ? I can ' t say NO enough . It just isn ' t worth it to play \" how to get it working this time \" every time a patch comes out . I ' m sure I am in the minority with this problem , but it shouldn ' t be a problem . Just for reference , I installed ( eventually ! ) on a newer model Alienware laptop purchased about 2 months ago .\n",

      "Example 0: I ' m going to try and write this as a non - hardcore ( I think just above casual ) perspective for those who may be approaching it from that side . I ' ve only beat the game once on the default difficulty with a Barbarian and have since started all the other classes ( none of which have finished Act I yet ) . I remember ~ 15 years ago when Diablo II was kind of a big deal but some how I could never quite get into it . I played a few times in a group locally with friends and tried to play through solo a few times but some how it just never quite grabbed me . This I decided to see what the big deal was with Diablo so I just started up a barbarian , followed along with the story , read all the dialog and tried to take it all in . In total , trying to explore a lot and experimenting with different armor buffs and level - achieved perks , it took around 20 hours to kill Diablo ( my Barbarian at level 32 at the end ) . I did die a few times a long the way but nothing impossible . For at least one boss I just had to step back a moment , examine what was happening and re - adjust my approach . What I realized as I entered the final moments of the game was the default difficulty is actually an extended tutorial so you can learn your chosen character class and what style of combat works for you . In other words this game is made with the assumption it is going to played over and over and over again . Diablo III isn ' t made to be played through once and you ' re done . If that ' s the plan you ' re in for a disappointment as the default difficulty is incredibly easy and the story exists just enough to as a device to keep hacking and slashing away . Having only played through once I ' m sure the \" real \" players would say I haven ' t \" really \" played the game at all . But this review isn ' t for those players , it ' s for a Diablo - curious types . For what ' s worth my Barbarian approach was to stun the enemies around me and try to affect them with an area - of - effect shout and spin attack to kill multiple at once . I think I killed around twenty enemies in one shot that way once or twice . As I assume many reviewers have mentioned this game is online - only , even when you ' re solo . I have run into a few instances in which latency has really hit me ( I have cable connection around 25Mbps down ) . Seems like if blizzard wants to cripple the game that way they have they should at least have such issues resolved or at least some way of smoothly adapting to it . The servers go down every so often and unlike SC2 no offline play at all . I don ' t mind so much ( I just read a book ) . I have played multiplayer a few times and popping in and out is rather seamless . I haven ' t felt the need to play multiplayer so much because I am still learning the ins and outs of the game play and different classes . I do actually find it fun and interesting to experiment with different combinations of class skills and armor buffs / runes . And that ' s what the real game is : the endless quest for more , better loot . I have yet to be forced into the auction house so I can ' t speak to that . Personally I think I would just play my humble random drop builds in perpetuity before I ' d pay in - game - gold or real money for loot necessary to keep playing . But that ' s just me . I still don ' t know if I ' m going to get into the game enough to play over and over and over to get the \" bestest loot ever \" . Perhaps I ' ll just get all my characters ( with the various classes ) up to level 60 ( or as close to it as I can anyway ) so I have some cool characters to play with online with friends . Or perhaps I ' ll get tired of it before that and never touch or think about it again . It could go either way .\n",

      "Example 0: Sometimes when they make the next game in a series it doesn ' t resemble anything like the previous game in the series . Well with Diablo III you don ' t have to worry about it the game looks exactly like Diablo 2 in fact you could probably call this Diablo 2 . 1 . Eleven years after Diablo 2 comes out and they haven ' t made hardly any changes that you can you tell , I ' m not sure what they were thinking . Here are my observations of the game . First the biggest thing is to play single player you have to play online through Battle Net . This has to be the dumbest idea they could have come up with . I had problems getting my account setup since I hadn ' t played Battle Net in about 10 years so I didn ' t remember my password and the other information to reset it . It took several hours to get the download and get my account straightened out . I was fortunate and didn ' t have any problems getting into Battle Net once I had my account setup . I did have problems once I got on ; I got kicked out of Battle Net 3 times during the game . Once after a major Boss Fight and I lost all of the treasure , which really made me mad . There is a lot of server lag where you are in a fight and one second you are toe to toe fighting it out and the next you ' re on the other side of the screen , so disappointing . The game took me about 25 hours to complete with a level 31 Barbarian . The graphics and music are pretty much the same as Diablo 2 and you still have this far away camera angle and you can ' t zoom in to your character . I guess it really doesn ' t matter since you can ' t really customize your character you ' re stuck with one of five premade character classes all with a male or female option . You would think after 11 years you would be able to customize what your character looks like hair color and style and facial hair or not , nope they made them for you and sometime they are just ugly . You would think if you play with friends you could get confused on which is your character . Like I said there is nothing new in the game I did notice that they removed the matched armor sets that if you got the entire set it would give you a bonus . The game just got tedious after a while and I had to force myself to complete the game . In fact the only thing I really liked was the cut scenes the animation is just mind blowing they look so good . The game isn ' t bad but it ' s not good either and with having to play a solo game online does move it to bad game . The whole DRM thing is just stupid ; it ' s like putting a sophisticated alarm system on a Yugo .\n",

Want to spend 2 hours clearing dungeons and get dropped by the Battle . net server - affirmative . Idiots ? ! This is mainly a single player game and saving progress in towns would help ; but , having to wait for checkpoints that you may or may not be anywhere near is ridiculous .

      "Example 0: LOST IMMERSION and STYLE - This sequel marks the end of Diablo series as we knew it . Unfortunately , not for the better . The game is generic and boring . Mainly due to oversimplification of the aspects that made prior games so successful , including character customization ( skills and items ) and story . The game immersion experience is as result poor and feels more like a fast paced combat or arcade game than a Role Playing Game . GraphicsWhile updated and more subtle , graphics fail to offer visibility and immersion . This has been the struggle of game developers in the last decade or so to introduce the 3rd dimension , and too often , it was a failure . In Diablo III , you end having neither the visibility you had when in isometric 2d , or the immersion you would have in total 3d . Additionally , the graphics are too cartoonish , cute and polished to provide the feeling you would expect in a dungeon crawling scary game . Diablo I and II were far more scary and offered enough ` evidence ' for your imagination to trigger visions of horrors . In game cut scenes are an absolutely joke and seem to have been made for an arcade game from the 80 ' s ( only slightly exaggerating . . . . ) , anyway , not in line with the sprit of the prior games slow , terrifying , intense cut scenes . Cinematics are as usual of the highest quality . Music and soundMusic and sound effects are excellent , even if you will find some of the merit is low given most comes the original game . Character voice : are you kidding me ? Just listen to the female monk and you will stop there . GameplayThat is where the disappointment is the largest : hardly any customization of character : we all follow the same blend generic skill progression path . ImmersionNone whatsoever . I feel absolutely not committed to my character whose development seems to be just following a script . Similarly , the story seems to be a generic repeat of prior games . All ( items , quests ) seems to be delivered too fast for me to actually care of the objective or the outcome . The quests are delivered by an actor reading very fast the highlights of you will end up having to do . Yes , no more slowly unfolding mystery : you know pretty much all from the first moment . So complete lack of style from the art direction . ItemsThis used to be the single point of unquestionable force of the prior versions gameplay . You are now overwhelmed with low quality items that hardly change anything to the gameplay : Diablo I and II were item based RPGs . It would make or break your character . Now , you have the choice every minute to change your items from lower quality to low quality . Blizzard went exactly the wrong way : they added even more varieties of the useless items . Of course , you can be sure that you will ultimately find some great items , but this may require some extra real money using the auction house done for this very purpose . Server DependencySo , there will be instances you are not able to play the game . And when you are , you may see all action suddently stopped . That ' s right : you are not in control , Battle net is . The final flaw that seals it all . Conclusion : sadly have to recommend you go look for other games , especially for this type of money . By the way if you have not noticed , I was and still am a huge fan of both Diablo I and II .\n",

      "Example 0: Do no feed the greedy animal that is Blizzard . Avoid paying any money on Blizzard ' s website or aution house . Let me explain : I loved Diablo 1 and 2 . But with Diablo 3 , I didn ' t bother to read Amazon ' s reviews thinking the low ratings were the result of angry gamers reacting to online issues that are normal with the launch of major games . Boy , was I wrong . You see , I spent over $ 800 upgrading my computer so I can play Diablo 3 at the highest settings . I tried the starter edition and paid $ 60 for the standard , download version . Guess what ? I can ' t progress beyond level 11 after I paid $ 60 . Blizzard din ' t even bother telling me why I can ' t progress . So I did some research online and found out that I have to wait 3 days to progress . WHY THE HELL DIDN ' T BLIZZARD WARN ME ABOUT THE 3 DAY DELAY ? I could have driven 5 minutes to my local game store to buy the disk version . My conclusion : Blizzard is deceptive and greedy , just as so many other reviewers on this site are saying : Blizzard allows items in the Auction House to be so inflated that it is extremely hard to earn enough gold to buy the good gear . Blizzard wants you to use real money to buy gear at the Auction House , thereby earning commission for each sale . I have never had this much hatred for a gaming company , but my experience with Diablo 3 is full of anger at Blizzard . Blizzard needs to do some damage repair with its fans or else all hell will break loose .\n",

I have played monk , wizard and demon hunter thus far through defeating Diablo , \" the Prime Evil \" . I started playing the witch doctor recently and only have barbarian then . From the characters I have played thus far , I believe the first few acts on normal are quite entertaining . I don ' t find myself kicking the can and dying all too much though through the first few acts which seems to happen often through the end of the game . Playing lower level characters hasn ' t yielded many legnedary items whatsoever . I believe I have only received 2 . I have 2 tabs in my stash full of low level rare items , but a majority of them are 13 - 37 weapons and 10 - 282 armor .

I have 3 characters leveled out at 32 sitting on Nightmare now with a new witch doctor almost through Act 1 . Gamplay is entertaining and the environments of the first 3 Acts are visually stunning .

      "Example 0: There ' s already so many reviews as to the problems of Diablo 3 , but I still want to share all my thoughts . To start , I was a long time fan of Blizzard and their games , from Starcraft and Diablo 2 to their usually unheard of Sega Genesis games . Starcraft II only showed me more perfection ( even if it had its own problems , but Starcraft wasn ' t balanced overnight ) . I played Diablo 2 for years , and am today still a gigantic fan of the ARPG genre , because of the ease and diversity , and the plain old addiction . I also want to say that if you ' ve never played Diablo 2 , you should . That will show you exactly why Diablo 3 isn ' t what it ' s supposed to be . Sadly , Diablo 3 was none of these . My main problems with Diablo 3 weren ' t actually the Real Money Auction House , it wasn ' t the always online DRM ( but that isn ' t alright either ) , it was how they mutilated the story , how they ruined the atmosphere and music , and how they drug the king of ARPGs down to the filth of mediocrity and monotony . On a first playthrough of Diablo 3 , you will probably love it . You ' ll think it ' s awesome , you ' ll think it ' s great , you ' ll think everything is fine and all the complainers are just uptight people who fell into the hype of a game from a massive gaming company . Once you play through it 10 more times , on every character , and have millions of gold , you ' ll see the issues . To start , the graphics . The cartoony graphics make everything look like World of Warcraft , which is not what Diablo is supposed to be . Sure , everything is silky smooth , the combat looks great , and the effects of the spells are pretty darn awesome , but none of it fits . None of it matches . It all looks way too overused and way too much like an MMORPG instead of a bloody hack and slash horror adventure . I also should mention the cutscenes , and while they look nearly realistic , the size proportions are terrible . Why is Leah a quarter of the size of Tyreal ? Next , the music . There ' s only one song that stands out , and it plays every time you log in . It sounds like an orchestra playing way too hard on their instruments in an attempt to make the song sound epic , and it just fails . All the other music gets washed out and doesn ' t sound remotely pleasing , and as a result , I haven ' t listened to it since release . Maybe the music has been updated in the recent patches , but I can ' t be bothered to find out ! Before going on to my biggest complaint , I ' ll throw in the small ones that just add up to make the game no good . For one , the \" randomized maps \" aren ' t random whatsoever . In Diablo 2 , I never knew where anything was , and today I still have no clue . In Diablo 3 , I know exactly where to go and exactly where to look , and it only took one playthrough . The level system is capped at level 60 , and that ' s more MMORPG standard , not ARPG , which they tried to fix by adding 100 Paragon levels , which was a solution to a problem that should never have existed . Because of this , you ' ll cap any character you play in a matter of days or less , with no motivation to play any more after you beat the game on Inferno . Speaking of Inferno , the supposed \" hard \" difficulty is made insanely easy by spending not much gold on the Auction House to vastly improve your gear , and then fly right on through every enemy and boss without so much as using a potion . You can raise the monster difficulty if you really want to , but why bother ? It ' s so boring playing through each and every act over and over again with zero map randomization that it really isn ' t very appealing . On top of all that , if you want a really expensive item , you can spend a quarter for 1 million gold on the RMAH and get it for not much money . Then there ' s the complete lack of multiplayer support . How does a video game that sells millions of copies have only 3 , 000 people on public games ? How can there be only 30 people in the chat channel I joined ? On top of that , you ' ll often find a grand total of 0 people doing a quest that you want to do , and if it ' s an especially bad one ( mostly located in Act 2 ) you ' ll be hard pressed to force yourself through to the end . PvP has been recently added , but as far as I ' ve heard that is no good either ( I ' m not a PvP person so I can ' t say whether or not this is true ) . Strangely , none of these issues are why I don ' t like Diablo 3 . I can go through change , I can understand why there ' s no differences between any characters , and I can live with all the crap that makes other people angry . What bothers me the most is what they did to the lore and story of the Diablo universe . If you care , there are possible spoilers ahead . Angels vs Demons with humans caught between is one of my favorite settings for any story , and Diablo 2 did that perfectly . There you were , some random person having to kill the Lords of Hell , with no help from Heaven , and only a vague mention of it because Tyreal was standing around . The cutscenes were cool , going into the Hellforge was cool , defeating all the brothers of Diablo was cool . The story had a sense of depth , a sense of epicness , a sense of utter failure should you not complete your goal . Act 1 of Diablo 3 goes along this line pretty well . There ' s King Leoric and his descent into madness , the mention of Belial and his minions , and the wonder of how Diablo is going to return . Act 1 also has a dark atmosphere with ghosts and skeletons , even in the cartoony style . The whole time I was sure I would see an epic ending in the end , but I was sorely disappointed . The downfall started in Act 2 . Set in the desert , you hunt down Belial . And that ' s it . There ' s no mad king , there ' s no side characters to follow a story . Sure , you fight and kill Magdha , but she wasn ' t very interesting , just a puppet of Belial who everybody knew was going to be a boss fight . Did I mention that the child king was Belial ? Everyone and their dog could have guessed that , what with his terrible accent . From this point on , the game loses any and all attempt at adding extra lore . Instead , it ' s get to the end of the act to kill that particular Lord of Hell . The ending cutscene of Act 2 was very promising , with Azmodan setting an assault on the Barbarian homelands . But even Act 3 was a disappointment . All the bosses before Azmodan felt thrown in there with no context as to who they were or why they were there . Also , how does the supposedly smartest and craftiest of the Lords of Hell let a single person through his entire army and down into his chamber only to slay his fat body on his throne ? All the while taunting you on your search , with a mere sensual spider getting in the way . And then we make it into Heaven in Act 4 . Diablo manages to break the impenetrable diamond gates ( no really , the Diamond Gates are supposed to be impenetrable , which means unbreakable ) after a short and pathetic skirmish with the head of the angels . Seriously , why do all the fights of the super powerful bad guy against the super powerful good guy end up with the good guy failing miserably and then being useless for the remainder of the story ? Anyway , the rest of this act is thwarting Diablo ' s every move and eventually defeating him on the Pinnacle of Heaven , with a very anti - climatic finishing cutscene . Sure , the story has many twists , with Tyreal becoming human ( which is just stupid , what ' s going to happen when he dies , become an Angel again ? ) and Leah turning into Diablo ( which gave Diablo a feminine form , and is fine to look at but does NOT match his character of the most evil thing to walk the earth ) . Then Leah ' s mother being a traitor , and . . . Well , that ' s about all the twists , actually . I could honestly go on for hours about the story , but that ' s all I want to put here on Amazon . Diablo 3 was a massive disappointment , and it just ended up being one right after the other . The game is a lot of fun , I got hundreds of hours out of it , but in the end it ' s just not what it was supposed to be . I fell into the hype and I expected it to be a 3D version of Diablo 2 , when it ' s really just a dumbed down World of Warcraft without a subscription fee .\n",

      "Example 0: The game is reasonably fun ( three stars , might push into four ) but it ' s completely unplayable . For a game where you kill creatures and collect loot , you ' d expect that you could just pay sixty bucks and do so . Not so much , actually . The fact that this game is Online ONLY means that as longs as the servers are running well and turned on , you may play . But should the company decide to shut off access to the game for any reason , you have a worthless piece of software on your hands . To be brutally honest in single player this game is no better than Torchlight ( which retails for far less ) , and I strongly suspect that Torchlight ' s sequel ( to be released in 2012 , for a third of Diablo III ' s price tag ) will at least equal it ' s co - op with the addition of multiplayer action to that series . I cannot recommend buying this game ( which is honestly rare . . . I can only think of a handful of other titles in the past couple of decades that I felt this strongly about ) at this point . This is the largest failure of the single player portion of a game due to technical reasons ( note : not game design ones , I ' ve seen enough in the Beta which was playable to know that it ' s an average action - RPG , hack , slash , loot , that ' s what they ' re all about ) that I have ever seen . It rivals the worst of the multiplayer debacles I have witnessed as far as launches go , however . As a longtime fan of the series ( I played the betas and release versions of Diablo and Diablo II ) I can say that I am deeply disappointed . If you have 60 bucks and have already purchased a load of other games and really just can ' t find anything better to do and really absolutely MUST buy ? Drop the money . If not , don ' t bother . There ' s a lot more games out there that offer you better , more innovative gameplay and do not cripple you by forcing you to always be online . ( This review is being updated as the release continues . ) Day two shows improved uptime , but reinforces how glaringly poor a decision it was to rely upon an online - only model . Server performance is wildly variable . Playing in single player mode , a gamer can find themselves rubber - banding across the screen and unable to properly enjoy the experience . ( At this time I think that people engaging in Hardcore game play are quite simply insane . ) There may be a greater opportunity to play now than there was on the release date itself , but the fact of the matter is that the technical experience is greatly sub - par for the genre . This review remains a one - star as a result . ( continued again ) The end of day two on into the third day of release shows massive lag issues continuing randomly when starting new games . You can swap characters from being \" lag - free \" ( no more than moderate latency ) and end up hopping and skipping all over the screen as you move between the stash and the smith with the next character . A single player experience in a normal game in the genre is latency - free because it is handled locally . You don ' t happen to just die because the server hiccups . ( Like I said : if you ' re one of the people playing hardcore I ' m convinced you ' re a madman at this point . ) Even should this issue be resolved , there ' s still the persistent fact that if you are not connected to the net for any reason whatsoever ( and that does happen , as I have stated above ) you simply cannot play . This alone knocks points off the game , and as Blizzard has no intention of changing that , I see no reason why this review will ever rise above a three star . ( And at that point I ' ll be generously forgiving its mediocrity combined with its technical faux pas . . . ) Further gameplay has revealed more mediocre skills and a distinct lack of balance between classes . Some of them are an absolute breeze , never even being touched . Others are forced to get in , mix it up , and get slapped around . . go figure which one is which . . . unless this somehow miraculously changes deeper into the game I anticipate some of those achievements will be pretty difficult to unlock indeed . . . ( final update ) Day three . Continuing issues . Major latency problems . Client / server asset disputes . Random errors preventing connections . Disconnects still abound . ( Mind you we ' re seeing these issues NOT during prime time . . . so supposedly when the load would be lighter they STILL suffer from these problems . ) The game gets a three star rating from me , period . It lost a full star for the technical issues . ( Those issues will never go away . they are not launch issues . They are design decisions deeply ingrained in the way Blizzard has chosen to do things . I am not reacting to the bad launch . I am seeing where this will continue to be a problem forever . ) It gets a total of four stars excluding technical issues because it is decent and entertaining , but it is by no stretch a five star game . For that you need a lot more than Blizzard has given us with this title . My final say is this : if you really need a new Action RPG and cannot wait for something better , then go for it . I would suggest the following titles be purchased before this one , however : Torchlight , Borderlands ( plus all DLC / GotY edition ) , Titan Quest ( plus expansions ) and , if it ' s released by the time you read this review , Torchlight 2 . ALl of these cost less than D3 and are at least as good if not better games , and none of them have the technical issues that D3 has .\n",

      "Example 0: I have to update my review . Months after release and playing more than 200 hours as well as trying out the other Action RPG competitors , I am glad the direction that Diablo went in . Compared to the previous installment , they did streamline the game to not feel so \" nuts and bolts . \" There are some things that this allows and prohibits . The one major downfall is that every character levels up the same . This limits the dynamics of the characters . Once you have a Barbarian or Demon Hunter already created , creating another is superfluous . However , it allows for a focus on skills and skill selection . Also , there are options to test different builds to one you like . Attributes are automatically distributed when you level , so the game becomes a little more results based . The drop rates are way better than months ago and Inferno difficulty is manageable than there were even 6 months ago . Multiplayer can be fun and as time went on , there are more options for those that don ' t participate . Patch 1 . 08 will enhance the benefits of multiplayer more . The RMAH was a bad idea and is now recognized as a bad idea by Blizzard . The auction house can be nice sometimes to open up different options . There is a sense of community that I don ' t see with the competitors with the online DRM , auction house , multiplayer etc . that I like , but most find these to be the greatest detriments to the game or the areas that need the most improvement . Unlike many games , this game is continually updated and revised . I ' ve put countless hours into this game . It is a wonderful value since it requires no additional costs .\n",

      "Example 0: It ' s hard to start talking about Diablo 3 because , as I see it - and I ' ve seen my opinion reflected on many other reviews - it has so many wrong things going on for it that it ' s kind of bewildering . I will try to express my disappointment and concern because I believe this game is a clear beacon as to to where video game developers are heading as of late , and a blatant case of how a company becomes so arrogant that it manages to neglect all inputs and feedback from its loyal fan base . So let ' s start with one of the biggest gripes people have had : the launch day fiasco . If it were any other developer in the world ( except maybe EA ) ; if they hadn ' t BETA - tested the game for many months and hadn ' t performed a public stress test two weeks prior to launch ; if they didn ' t have the experience with WoW and SC2 , it would be almost forgivable . But no , the had all the data , all the experience and all the means of supporting the launch for the game , and they miserably failed at it . And why wouldn ' t they fail at it ? In today ' s business of pre - orders we finance video game development and receive nothing back , and we don ' t even demand anything back from them . Blizzard had the obligation of giving a working piece of software for all of us that payed the price for it in advance , and they get away with a lame excuse in their website ? This is just so wrong , in so many levels . The gameplay was really dumbed - down and everyone is talking about it . The graphics , for me , aren ' t an issue , but the animations are ludicrously bad . Try watching the Demon Hunter fire two crossbows at once and you ' ll see what I mean bay BAD ANIMATION . Other aspects of the game that really stand out like a sore thumb : the quest screen is useless . Whereas in Diablo 2 you had a screen showing which quests you had completed , which was active and details on it , now you have a very vague description of your current task . If you want to see any piece of lore or any detail on your past exploits , you need to painfully navigate lots of sub menus . This has written \" rushed \" all over it . The very streamlined stats screen is also a joke , and if compared to the one from Diablo 2 it could easily be mistaken by a Diablo Lite version . And now , for my biggest gripe with the game . . . The story line , the characters and the whole universe of Diablo 3 . * * * Spoiler alert , don ' t continue reading if you haven ' t finished at least act 1 * * * In Diablo 2 we ' re greeted by this epic intro scene where we ' d be introduced to the Wanderer in this very creepy mausoleum . We ' d also witness what lied in his wake as an inn was engulfed in flames . And thus would begin our journey . Now we ' re introduced to Cain and his anime - inspired teen niece who had NEVER BEEN PRESENT IN THE OTHER GAMES . Now she magically appears and , as the intro goes on , we hear this annoying new narrator scream \" uncle \" just before the supposedly intimidating Diablo 3 logo is shown . It ' s such an anticlimax start . The story is so bad , so stupid that they managed to have Deckard Cain survive a meteor crash and escape the Skeleton King only to be killed at the end of Act 1 . The single most likable and recognized character in the series is thrown in the trash and replaced by this very annoying niece . Also , if the niece wasn ' t a dumb choice to begin with , she is given some sort of \" secret powers \" that conveniently manifest at key times in the narrative , showing not only a lack of creativity but a total deus ex machina gimmick . Diablo 3 deserves to be panned as it ' s been . It is the pinnacle of everything that is wrong with the video game development now a days : games being released with bugs , companies not measuring up to the ludicrous hype THEY create , not having to answer for the fact the game , which was already bought months earlier , does not run , simplified and dumbed - down gameplay , etc etc . Indies , help us !\n",

      "Example 0: The permanent internet connection was announced byBlizzard several months ago , its goal ? stop piracy . The game is more like Diablo 1 than Diablo 2 . I think that Blizzard tried to recover andimprove the original game . The game is short and somewhat linear but does not cease to be good . The best of the game ? the gold ' s auction house .

      "Example 0: - ABOUT MY FORMER LOVE OF BLIZZARD - I have bought the full version of every blizzard game ever made . I was one of the 1 , 000 beta testers of Diablo II . I bought the collectors version of world of warcraft and diablo 3 . I WAS a fan - boy . I think the activision / blizzard merger and sloughing off of their original team has obliterated the spirit of this company . # 1 COMPLAINT - IMPOSSIBLE & CHEAP DIFFICULTY - Diablo 3 has been a horrible disappointment for me . In hell mode , not even inferno mode , with max gear bought off the auction house , I die in 1 hit from normal mobs . I am a witch doctor . This game is supposed to be a hack and slash . Hack and slash should be somewhat laid back , even in harder difficulties , like Diablo II was . Granted it should have hard moments , but you shouldn ' t hit a brick wall every 2 minutes , that is if you can even get past the first brick wall . There are so many countless ways for mobs to kill you instantly . Instant death is around every corner . It makes the game a horribly painful experience . And the instant death is often quite cheap . For example a mob can pull you to them from across the screen and 1 hit you . A mob can die , and when they instantly explode on death which instantly kills you , which is especially horrible for melee classes . They can put up an impenetrable wall behind you , and a laser that rakes across you , killing you instantly . Some mobs run twice as fast as you and 1 - hit you . You cannot esc quit . There are no counters to these things . It doesn ' t matter what your skill level is , you will die , and die , and die . In multiplayer games , players simply drop out when there are mobs like these . You will not be able to do a play - through of an act in later difficulty with the same players because death is so frequent people simply give up . - HOPELESS HARDCORE MODE - In hardcore mode you will be lucky to make it past nightmare difficulty . I wouldn ' t even consider making a hardcore mode character . In Diablo II I had a couple level 90 + hardcore ' s . That was the main reason I was looking forward to Diablo III , all the fun I had in tense boss fights hoping I wouldn ' t die with my hardcore character , but if I did starting over was still fun . With Diablo III , you die so much it ' s pointless to even try . It ' s not fun at all , just 100 % guaranteed death and disappointment because you know your death will be based not on a miss - step , but on an undefeatable foe . - CHINESE BOT - FARM AUCTION HALL - Auto farming bots that farm gold 24 / 7 have already inflated auction hall prices into the millions of gold for a single item . A mob will drop around 100 gold in hell difficulty , and take maybe a minute to kill since it has to be kited so you don ' t get hit . So if you are a legit player , you are basically out of luck unless you are willing to pay American dollars for pretend gold from China . And blizzard gets a whopping 15 % cut . Blizzard succeeded in somehow making the problem of Chinese gold farmers even worse than it already was , and also succeeded in coming off as just another sleezy game company that doesn ' t care about game balancing or the spirit of fair competition . - CONCLUSION - This is not the laid back and enjoyable hack and slash that hardcore - hell - mode diablo II was , this is a real life nightmare that you can only wake up from by not playing the game . - AWESOME CINEMATICS - The cinematics are awesome , watch them online .\n",

      "Example 0: Dialogues are cliche and cheesy . The story is shallow and silly . The game doesn ' t live up to the legacy of the great Diablo 2 . D3 has sold like hot cakes because no game has successfully emulated the addictive nature of D2 in its genre in over a decade , and therefore gamers were waiting for a very long time to find a legitimate replacement for D2 . Some may have settled for it , and some may have bought it without any prior experience with this franchise . But the majority of D2 players are still angry at this game because it turned out to be an mediocre action game stripped of any meaningful customization . Your barbarian character has same stats as millions of others . No customization what so ever . No skill tree what so ever . Did I mention the items have boring and blatantly simple attributes ( + dex , + str , + int ) ? Where is the fun beyond level 40 or so when you already beat the game on two difficulties ? The game provides no end - game content except two more mindless difficulties , until you eventually get gears good enough to beat the game on the Inferno difficulty . Then you have nothing to look forward to , because PvP is garbage in this game , and its online design is quite anti - social . ( The game sold over 11 million copies , and there are only a 100 players playing in public games . This isn ' t even a joke . Everyone is playing solo mode because the game provides zero incentives or fun . )\n",

      "Example 0: I was big fan of Blizzard , I practically grew up playing their games and saw how they came up from being my favorite \" small video game company \" to this titan corporation on the market , and I couldn ' t be happier . However , is very apparent to everyone that is not completely blinded by their fanatism for Blizzard , or lacks one cent of objectivity , that Blizzard has transformed into this 100 % profit seeking - board pleasing corporation with no other priority other than making as much money as possible no mather what . Look , I ' m ok with companies doing that , if their product continues to improve or at the very least remains top quality . Unfortunately that ' s not the case with Blizzard , they are no longer this \" quality benchmark \" or \" standard placer \" on the market as the original Warcraft , Starcraft and Diablo games did . And nothing proves it more than Diablo 3 . Basically , if you haven ' t bought the game , let me resume it in few sentences . They spent far more time in trying to develop this cash milking idea of real money auction house than they ever spent on working in the story line , mechanics , game depth , etc etc . I mean , as their crash - n - burn launch was happening , literally , their message from the Blizzard team on their website was regarding how the real - money auction house was delayed for few weeks . . . . . really ? That shows you were their mind is , while millions of players in north america were angry because they couldn ' t play their single player game that requires full time internet connection , according to Blizzard the most pressing issue at that moment that required inmediate addressing was . . . . the fact that their Real money Auction house was down . If you are a RPG lover , or just a player that enjoys the occassional good RPG and has played any of the recent ones . . . save your money . You will get bored of diablo 3 in propably a week or 2 . The only reason to continue playing this game beyong the first 2 full runs ( which happens really fast ) , is to farm for money or try getting the most amaizing gear ever which btw ends up being completely pointless because there is not even a PvP system ( they say it will be released in the future , but they said the same almost 2 years ago about SC2 team support , market and other features , and still hasn ' t happened ) . I mean honestly , coming to play diablo 3 from recently released RPGs like Mass Effect 3 , Kingsdoms of Amalaur , Skyrim and others , you feel that this game should be free , or it was made by an Indi company . Err . . . nevermind , Indi companies have better inspiration and would ' ve probably written a better more compelling story line . Bottom line , a poor RPG for today ' s market , specially coming from recently released RPGs that are now half the price almost . Mediocre mechanics , 0 game depth and a story line that a 5th grader could ' ve written better in less than a week . It ' s basically Diablo 2 with updated graphics and more streamlined and dumbed down interface mechanics and no comparabble story telling . Worst part is . . . . . . that you can ' t expect anything better than this from Blizzard in the future . Oh , yeah , did I metioned that the game failed to work for the first 5 days after lanunch ? and that their forums continue to be plagued by people having horrible experiences with errors , crashes , unsupported video cards , and no less importantly a recently wave of hackings that happen on real time to people that have authenticators , double firewalls , etc . . . and Blizzards resonse seems to be \" your problem bro \" ? ? Yeah . . . .\n",

      "Example 0: Up front , I ' ve played all 6 characters through levels ranging from 6 to 11 . First , there has been really little change to the gameplay . Go out , hammer monsters until you make it to pick up whatever the quest demands and pick up lots of loot . That ' s not really anything to wait 12 years to play . Next , I never really played Diablo for the companionship of others , so did not need an internet connection . Diablo III requires you be on line at all times to play , which led to some of their server issues on opening day . Additionally , I apparently get a lot of information from the servers because I have had beasts ' teleport ' ( not the special ability ) from one side of the screen to the other . LAG ! ? Really ? This program should be entirely resident on my computer with just a check - in on the server saying , \" Go play dear . \" Moving on to character development , RPGs involve choice and D3 has moved away from that . All of your skills will become available as you progress through the levels . There is no agony of choice , dealing with a set of skills that make things more difficult with certain monster types ( and , incidentally , driving a need to group with others ) . You have 6 ' active ' slots which have 4 assigned skills each and 3 passive slots . With a minimal cooldown period , you can switch the skills around . You don ' t even get to distribute str / dex / con attribute points . These make it more a . . . third person tactical dungeon hack minus RPG elements ( except for the class choice itself ) . On a positive note , it ' s very pretty . However , my characters look like they are permanently in ' bullet time ' ( 6 Million Dollar Man motion ) when they are running around and the attacks seem to go * really * slow . Anyone who did not play D3 will probably enjoy this game . Considering it has been 12 years , there ' s a generation that may not have . Most folks who are Diablo veterans though will not see a vast improvement and may be disappointed like Matrix lovers hated Matrix : revolutions . Good Luck ,\n",

      "Example 0: Diablo III is possibly the most hotly anticipated PC game of all time , and considering the huge following of Diablo II , it had some big shoes to fill . The game we got has ended up being very divisive - a lot of folks don ' t like it much , as evidenced by its rating here . I love it to pieces , but a lot of the experience SURROUNDING the game is hugely disappointing . I ' ll spare you summaries and just jump to the key points : GAMEPLAYThe area where D3 most shines . Gameplay feels a LOT like Diablo II , but a bit more dynamic and alive - knockback actually launches enemies ( and you ) into the air , there are dodge moves , and magic spells are a lot more diverse than in the past . The game feels even more arcade - like than its predecessor with big , flashy fights that are a lot of fun ( if a little confusing at times ) . Purists aren ' t all happy with how skills work - unlike Diablo II you can unlock every skill for your character , and they level up automatically as you do . This means you probably won ' t build 3 or 4 barbarians for kicks , but it also means no more working on your character for weeks only to realize you built them wrong . Controls are slick and responsive . GRAPHICSDiablo III is a direct evolution from Diablo II artistically . That means you see everything from a locked 3 / 4 perspective ; any zooming during cutscenes is lenticular and not physical . During gameplay you cannot zoom or rotate . This is all done to accomodate the clever use of sprites and low - poly models to simulate a much more detailed world than actually exists in - game . It works to a point . Outdoor environments look outstanding , and everything has a sort of painterly look to it . However here and there a tree will look a bit flat or a character model will show a rough corner . This game was in development a long time and it shows . I can ' t help but feel that the graphics also suffer so that the game can accommodate the weaker computers of Blizzard fans who thusfar have only played the lower - requirement World of Warcraft . That ' s great and all , but I don ' t like my experience suffering so Blizzard can double - dip on its fanbase . SOUNDIt ' s a Blizzard game . They do game audio better than just about anyone , except maybe Valve . Not really much else to say , if you played Diablo I and II you can guess about how this one will sound . MULTIPLAYERHere ' s where things begin to unravel a little . Multiplayer itself is fast and seamless - find your friends , join their game , PROFIT . But the general chat channel is full of spambots , and you will get constant friend requests from spammers . Welcome to the Blizzard social hell that WoW players have endured since the dawn of time . Crooked BS and suspect invites are so rampant that generally you will end up just playing with friends and gradually friending THEIR friends - a sad thing when starting a fully public game is pretty easy . But what should be a fun experience with neat strangers gets old fast when a couple scammers jump in your game . Two more downsides are that multiplayer servers hold only 4 people ( half of Diablo II ' s limit ) and PVP , a much advertised feature , does not actually exist yet . SUPPORTThe dealbreaker for many . Diablo III requires that you be logged into Battlenet to play . Battlenet undergoes more maintenance than Cher ' s bustline . If you were one of the thousands of people who skipped work to play on launch day you got a nice 6 hour break in the middle of the day when your game was unplayable . It ' s gotten better , but there are still outages , particularly in the EU . The number of times Diablo II went down for me ? ZERO . Just saying . So far the always - online aspect SEEMS to at least prevent cheating , but then I only play with people I know . THE ENDGAMEDiablo fans know you don ' t beat the game in one playthrough - it now takes 4 thanks to a new difficulty , Inferno . Unfortunately , somewhere in your road to victory you will probably hit a wall . At level 60 you stop leveling and only improve through gear , which means eventually you must stop by the AUCTION HOUSE . 2 are on tap , a cash one and one that uses in - game currency . Both are grossly inflated . A lot of people resent having to buy and sell in order to progress , rightly saying that the auction mechanic hurts immersion and slows gameplay . I don ' t mind it but I won ' t call those people wrong either . OVERALLDiablo III is in most respects the game I wanted - an action - packed hack ' n ' slash with adequate graphics , great sound , and fun multiplayer . Could it be better ? Absolutely , and given Blizzard ' s reputation for perfection ( everyone forgets Rock ' n ' Roll Racing ) that may cost it more points than it would another game . It ' s hard not to balk at all the Warcraft conceits slipping into Diablo , or Blizzard ' s dodgy servers , or how many ways the game feels scaled back . BUT it ' s still a Blizzard game , it ' s STILL Diablo , and it ' s STILL better than 9 / 10 of what ' s on the market . Here ' s hoping they keep improving it with patches , and the player base sticks with it .\n",

This is a review for hardcore players mainly . What are the issues with this long awaited game ? you cant play single player offline , you have to be online at all times in order to play the game ! You have to wait during \" maitenance schedules \" which means blizzard turns off the servers and you dont get to play until they are done \" fixing \" problems which can take anywhere from 4 - 5 hours or even the whole day . You cant be disconnected in hardcore mode or you will automatically lose your character , even if the problem is caused by blizzards server you cannot request for a revive or have your 100 + hours of work returned to you , you lose not because you played the correct way but because blizzard lacks the responsibility to maintain a safe and secure network . You are online the whole time , if your router , a storm comes any sort of problem occurs , you cannot reverse it , your hardcore character is screwed ! There are hackers who are depeleting people of their in - game money , hacking peoples accounts and changing login information , there are patches that make the game worse and there is also an auction where you purchase items for your character . thats right you dont need to farm anymore you purchase ! in fact its required that you purchase in order to progress . the game also takes away the fun when you realize everything is \" cookie cutter . \" a cookie cutter is a system where the game forces the player to choose certain stats for the character they are playing without giving the player the freedom to choose for his / herself . you are playing blizzards way , you are not playing your way . once you see these problems clearly , there is no more fun for the game , the replay - ability is gone . your 60 $ - 100 $ is also gone , and deposited into a billion dollar sharehold no longer holding the title \" blizzard north . \" You are just another crazy amazon reviewer , what are you talking about ? To be honest I feel cheated . I waited 10 years for this \" amazing \" game ! Ive been through the first the second diablo the expansion , anyone from that time period who enjoyed the franchise for what it was would be a fool not to have purchased d3 from launch . Its sad to see that these companies are not respecting anymore what customers want , they are making everything a business and putting down rules that break players freedom in enjoying the game . first there was the change in graphics , the toned down gore , the short story , the lag , the lag spikes , people filling up chat with ads from china , items becoming useless without buying from ah , problems with playing hardcore without being paranoid of blizzards servers , having to wait for maitenance periods . I just want to enjoy the game , I dont want any problems . I dont want to wait 10 years to discover there are still problems . Why blizzard ? You are a billion dollar company . billion dollars ! you have laid off workers to make more money , you have screwed the community into buying this game based on a franchise that used to be reputable . You have turned it all into a business for the benefit of yourselves . I dont know why people would consider supporting you , we dont have forever to live so if your going to release another game during the next 10 years , you already know I set sail to a different boat and hope yours reaches the iceberg sooner than later .\n",

      "Example 0: Ok so first of all after actually playing this game the only reason I can imagine anyone would give it only one star is rage toward the real money auction house . Yes greed is bad . . . now that is established a real review . This game actually has a lot to like . ( A lot to hate as well but I ' ll get to that . ) First of all game play is fun . The best I can think to describe it is a hybrid of Diablo 2 and Dragon Age Origins . ( Although DA : O had a lot more content . ) The abilities are mostly fairly unique to the class and each is a completely different experience . ( Game play not story . ) You basically get 6 skill slots but are restricted to a list of spells for each specific slot , and then can further customize it with rune selection for the spell . The other thing I really like about this game is shared achievements across characters , although they still are mostly really stupid \" achievements . \" YOU REACHED LEVEL 10 ! ! ! yay ? . . . There are a ton of things that made absolutely no sense for them to do . Base stats are not chosen at all , and furthermore of the 4 main stats only 2 really do anything . Vitality increases health for each class and then each class has one stat that increases damage while the rest do hardly anything at all . Why even have separate stats if they were going to do that , why not simply combine them ? The only thing it accomplishes is ruining gear by having useless stats randomized onto it along with useful ones . You also don ' t choose the spells your character learns but rather they are unlocked as you level and you choose which to use in that skill slot . It is 6 separate spell lists as well , so it is highly restrictive of combinations you can use . In other words there is absolutely no character customization , making your character exactly the same as every other of the same class and level . If you played Diablo 2 you know how important mana was for most classes . Diablo 3 completely changed how it works . Basically all classes have a separate type of resource that is basically mana with a different name , and functions very similarly across each class . You get a very small mana pool , very high regen , and some of your spells replenish mana rather than cost . So after you get used to your spells for most spell setups it turns into clicking the right mouse button until out of mana then clicking the left mouse button until it is full again , then repeating while situationally using the other 4 spells . And again there is not much you can do to change this since there is no character customization . ( Although some gear adds to max mana pool . ) Speaking of casting spells , they are based on weapon damage . This isn ' t necessarily bad , but if you are a ranged spellcaster ( Witch Doctor or Wizard ) wearing melee weapons you will get full damage credit . The problem with this is that when you run out of mana when casting spells it defaults to weapon attack . . . meaning if you are wearing melee weapons you are going to charge into melee range of the things trying to kill you every time you run out of mana . Considering how high melee weapon drop rates are compared to ranged this is a very big issue . This is something that absolutely confounds me . The only ways to group are an auto - que or direct invite to a player . In these automated groups players anywhere in game get main quest credit . Most XP comes from quests rather than kills so they get most XP as well . It also informs them if you start and side quests and allows them to teleport directly to you to get quest credit . ( Or for any other reason . ) Now there is a vote kick option enabling you to get rid of players not contributing , but it has 2 very big flaws . First you can ' t kick someone if they aren ' t in the same zone as you , meaning that while teleporting to town might let you kick a normal leeching player ; the ones with chinese symbols for names sitting in some obscure zone require you to travel all the way to that place just to get rid of them . Second they still get credit for everything you already did before removing them . . . I was in a game earlier today where 3 people sat in town as me and one other person killed everything , then they just accepted the auto summon for bosses . After awhile we got pissed and left . They still had all that progress without so much as leaving town other than clicking the yes button for summons then teleporting back after the boss died . In Diablo 2 Necromancers were enjoyable to me in part because a part of your strategy was keeping all the pets up while also using direct offensive and defensive spells . In D3 their replacement , Witch Doctors , are nothing like that . Pets are a single cast for all of that type and the cast has a cooldown . There also aren ' t very many pets . There are really a ton more issues this game has , but that ' s all I ' m writing .\n",

You are pretty much renting this game . If you have a poor or no connection , too bad you can ' t play .

      "Example 0: Okay , I will try to keep this review short and concise but don ' t hold me to this promise . My WOW subscription was about to expire and I received an offer from Blizzard telling me that if I renew it for 1 year I will get Diablo 3 for free . Well , I wasn ' t thinking of renewing WOW since I ' ve played it for a while and I was about to quit . However , I was planning to buy D3 because I wanted a single player rpg game that I could take with me on road trips , vacation or in a flight . So , at that moment I thought well I will probably spend $ 60 on D3 anyways , what is a few more dollars for WOW do to me for another year subscription . I was wrong , had I know that this game required a constant online connection I would have not renewed my WOW subscription and spent over $ 70 + . After I downloaded and installed it I went to play and I was astonished that I needed to log on . At first I thought it was to validate my copy since I didn ' t purchase a physical copy of the game but NO , it was to play ! ! ! I felt cheated , wronged , and misled . I don ' t remember Blizzard ' s offer ever telling me that this game required an online connection . Your classic bait and switch , I can probably see a class suit over this issue . Besides , I don ' t see any real benefit to this online connection , no PVP , no guilds , no raids , etc . . . I can see myself playing this game for about 1 - 2 months to beat it since I have a small child and I can only play 1 hour or 2 a few days a week but above all I see no replay value and no portability . I also ran into the gear deficiency issue in Act I , Yes , Act I people ! ! ! I didn ' t bother buying anything in the AH while I was playing this act so once I got to the final boss , I couldn ' t beat him with the crappy gear I had collected from drops so , I had to go to the AH and spend a few hours looking for items in order to beat him ( buyout only auctions , I didn ' t feel like bidding and waiting 1 day to play this supposedly single player game ) . Now , here lies a potential problem , I can only imagine this gear problem getting worse over the remaining acts and in the higher difficulty settings . Thus , my biggest concern is that I don ' t plan to spend real money on the real money auction house ( RMAH ) but I can see once the RMAH issue is up and running all the decent gear will go there and make the VMAH useless . In other words , if you were seeking a single player game that you could take with you on the go such as a road trip , family visit , library , etc . . . , look for another game and save your hard earned money .\n",

      "Example 0: It has been about a year since the release of Diablo 3 and lots of things have been patched into the game to address the many faults it had at launch . You can now reliably ( servers only down for a few hours on Tuesday for server maintenance ) play the game up to level 160 ( 60 base levels , 100 paragon levels were patched in later ) , and have incentive to play public games ( more party members = increased XP and magic find ) . What hasn ' t changed is the core of the game , skills and items which is where the problem is for D3 . First off , if you played Diablo 2 and are looking at Diablo 3 for some more of that great stuff , look somewhere else . Diablo 3 is not in the same vein as Diablo 1 or 2 . Lost are the grit and dark shadows and instead you corny references to TV shows like LOST and endless pointless dialogue between your followers talking about things like flirting . There is no option to turn the forced dialogue off and just about everything has something to say . Even the cinematics are annoying in that you have to suffer through them everytime you complete an act or important quest unless you mash the esc key as they are loading up . If you have played D2 then you might suggest looking for the option to turn off cinematics like how it was in D2 . Well , there is no option like that which brings me back to the point that this is not a progression in the Diablo franchise but rather a very obvious money grab by a monolith developer like Blizzard . Other things lost that are being demanded by fans to be brought back are a way to ID all things in stash ( which was recently patched in after a year of demands ) , a weapon swap ability , interconnected waypoints through acts , ability to make named games in battle net , ability to fight previous bosses without having to back out of a game to start a game on that specific quest , PVP , etc . While some of those things may not matter much to everyone , there is one thing that should and that is PVP . Diablo 3 was released without PVP and it was promised that it would be coming . Well it came and it was revealed that they had been lying to us . What we got instead was something very pointless they decided to call Brawling which is basically a very watered down version of what they had promised us . Instead of match making or a list of perameters or anything , instead all you get to do is wait in a temple for other players to come along and fight eachother . He could be way over - powered for you or you could be way - overpowered for him . At of the end of the day it is not fun , interesting or worthwhile . So finally on the game itself ; its not bad . It feels fun to mow down pack of monsters and to progress . It feels good unlocking skills the first time . It feels great to take down a boss who you couldnt before . But those feelings fade fast . The game is shallow once you get down to it ( look at the item diversity , there is none ! ) . It plays like a side game to the ever present auction house . You dont find your best items , you buy them on the AH . You dont trade your found loot , you sell it on the AH . Soon , youll be on the AH more than the game itself , looking for the best deals or hoping to snatch up an undervalued item . And thats when you realize that this game isnt much of a game at all , its more like playing in a virtual economy where the goal is to always get more money . Personally , I don ' t think that the game being so bad isn ' t entirely Blizzard ' s fault . Its more or less the sign of the times where everything has to be monetized and free - to - play games charge $ 1000s of dollars to little kids parents . Its just a shame that it had to happen to one of my favorite franchises .\n",

      "Example 0: There is not a lot that hasn ' t been hashed here over and over . But I ' ll give my review none - the - less in the hopes somebody finds something fresh in it . So here is my list of 10 things that matter to me with Diablo III : 1 . ) I bought the game and had no problem logging in , nor playing at will . A lot of the poor early reviews should be revised on this alone . It appears that the early server issues have been resolved and there have been two game patches to date to fix some other random issues . My experience ( just from a game running standpoint ) is that the game runs fine on my slightly older middle of the road machine and a decent cable connection . 2 . ) This whole DRM thing doesn ' t bother me a bit . I think it is a little funny people are up in arms over this . However , they ' ll shoot pictures of themselves all day long on camera phones and text them , Tweet their daily lives to strangers , or post the same Tweets and pictures to Facebook for the whole world to see . If they only knew who had access to that data , worrying about being online to play a game would seem trivial . 3 . ) Upon starting the game , the characters seem a little cartoonist in graphical style . Not my gig , but after a few hours of play , didn ' t really detract from the game . The one big drawback for me is that you once again can ' t change the camera angle or game play from being over top of the character . No zoom or first person perspective the way you can in Skyrim , for example . I think for a \" new \" game 6 years in development that they missed the boat here . 4 . ) Graphics are decent , but not stellar considering it is 2012 . The good is that on a older machine you can play on high settings and it looks very good . The bad is that on newer machines you don ' t get near the graphical detail you ' d be expecting from a game surrounded by this much hype . Nobody wants to buy a new high end gaming rig to play Diablo III , but it is hardly making my machine sweat . Again , considering other offerings like Skyrim , this game seems oddly dated already considering both cost $ 60 and one delivers and one doesn ' t . 5 . ) The story is pretty boring . Nothing new . Nothing exciting . Same old plug the hole in the earth from the evil that is trying to invade it kind of grind . I guess all these years later it is getting harder for D & D ; stories to vary much but I ' d sure like to see someone try a novel approach . 6 . ) Voice acting is abysmal . The old wizard at the start of the game sounds like they drug him out of the guard house to their corporate headquarters . The voice work alone almost ruins the game for me as each time there is dialogue I cringe . Blizzard must have just picked in house random people as that is the level of talent you get . Also , the game sound is nothing spectacular . Your high end audio cards won ' t be needed as surround sound doesn ' t appear to even be supported . If it is , I can ' t tell it is so crappy . 7 . ) On normal difficulty , the game is hardly challenging . As a Wizard , I just waded into a group of enemies , waited for them to surround me , froze them , and then start bombing away with spells watching them explode all around me . It gets quite repetitive and I found myself using the same attacks over and over without the need to change spells , etc . It would have been nice to need to strategically plan encounters . Okay , this enemy hates fire , or that one hates cold . Instead , I just bombed away with the same three spells killing everything . Also , not being able to set the difficulty level at the start really detracts from the game to me . As a hardcore gamer it just seems like a no brain - er in today ' s world . Let us pick . If the game is too hard , we can always select an easier mode . Blizzard making us play to unlock harder levels just sucks and is hardly exciting . 8 . ) I have not used the auction house , nor have I found a reason to at this point . I have found everything I need , or have bought if from merchants . I have not hit a road bump yet that made me think , maybe I need to go there to find better armor or weapons to get past this part of the game . Same thing with crafting items . It seems like it was almost an afterthought . Considering what you find in the game , and what you can buy from merchants , and what you could buy at the auction house , it sort seems like a waste of energy to try and make objects . Not only that , but the magical properties of many of your items are randomly generated so you don ' t even know if your time and effort will create something your character really benefits from . 9 . ) Character classes are essentially the same . No real outside the box thinking here other than the witch doctor . Again , not much exciting and new in your character development . 10 . ) Worth maybe $ 29 . 99 but no way is this game worth $ 60 . So there you have it . I really want to love the game but just can ' t seem to find enough in it to get me over the hump . To me , Diablo III is a middle of the road game that will produce multiple hours of decent enjoyment and nothing more . Not horrible , but not great either . That being said , it is hardly worth the $ 60 price of entry at this point . Wait for it to come down to $ 30 or less and you ' ll have an excuse to play it without feeling like you just got wrecked by the Butcher .\n",

      "Example 0: Necesity to be online at all times . This means if you don ' t have an internet connection active ; you can ' t play . It also means that even though you may own this game , if Blizzard ' s servers go down for whatever reason , you can ' t play .

Pvp is not available in game at this point which I don ' t get as it was advertised as being part of it , and yet it ' s a ghost . The auciton house ( gold ) is constantly down or buggy . The real money auction house version has been pushed back for the third week in a row . Again these are things that were promised as part of a game you own , not a subscription game , YET they are non - existant . Do you buy a refridgerator and accept that the manufacturer says you can ' t use the freezer for a month ? No , well you shouldn ' t expect that with a game that you are buying to own either . Don ' t like it ? Blizzard nor their employees and fanboys don ' t care ; see forum ' s for evidence of this . Online general chat is filled with chinese spambots trying to sell you in game gold for real money . This totally destroys any sense of communication as it is a constant . These are big paragraphs that go by in clusters every couple minutes . Chat is also filled with numerous people talking very dirty sexually , and making numerous violent and racist things . Party chat is also filled with this . This is beyond a M rating for the chat alone ; no wonder online interaction is not rated . The forums for this game are filled with these types of people as well . Just today i witnessed a forum thread entitled : \" Kill Yourself . \" The author was suggesting you commit suicide in real life if you had a problem with this game being offline . Blizzard not removing such a thread says a lot for them as far as I ' m concerned . In general I find the game very laggy which makes it difficult to play . I have encountered numerous people voicing similar complaints . Their are also many , many people who have had hacked accounts so early into the release of this game . It is scary to think of the large scale this is happening at already . Blizzard as well as their fanboys and undercover employees place absolute blame on the individuals who had the hacked account . The game is very short in general . If you are of moderate ability as far as gaming goes you can expect to finish the story within 7 hours at most . After that it ' s all repeat on higher difficulty . The story is poorly composed , and the gameplay is clearly targeting people of low ability as far as gaming go . Like many people say , this is a $ 40 game with a $ 60 price tag . That 40 is only if everything worked , which it doesnt . Even when they get everything working I would suggest against making the transition onto Diablo ' s poorly made world . Their are an ample supply of alternative games to choose from . You should pursue anything else .\n",

      "Example 0: I ' ve been a Blizzard fan ever since the days of Warcraft 2 . Few companies have delivered quality games with such consistency as Blizzard has . Sadly , that trend of quality seems to have waned in recent years , particularly since Blizzard ' s merger with Activision in 2008 . The focus shifted away from delivering the highest possible quality of product , and toward milking as much money as possible out of these games . It began with World of Warcraft , and the overhauls in the game intended to add as many paying subscribers as possible , while leaving the longtime players hanging out to dry . Then it became the sale of in - game vanity items for real cash , in a game that already charges $ 40 for an expansion every 2 years on top of the existing $ 15 monthly fee . In Starcraft 2 , there was surprisingly very little milking of the product on the surface . This is likely due to the fact that this is the eSports poster child for Blizzard , and there ' s just not that much to sell cosmetically in a RTS . However , they did plan for 2 expansions right off of the bat , and there is talk of selling custom maps for real money in the future . But for the most part , Starcraft 2 is actually a quality title , and one that I will continue to play and enjoy . Sadly , the same amount of time and effort put into Starcraft 2 was not made here . Diablo 3 , while pretty , is not a very deep or complex game . It is mostly a spammable clickfest , where you occasionally get a shiny item that may or may not be useful to you . Strategy is limited to \" stay out of the glowing stuff , click the bad guy until he falls over \" . You beat the game in about 6 hours , at which point you ' re invited to play the exact same game through a second time , and then a third time , and then a fourth time . That ' s the extent of replayability in this game . Play the exact same 6 hour stretch of content over and over and over again , just hoping that the right shiny thing drops for you . One addition of controversy in this game is the \" Real Money Auction House \" , where players are able to buy and sell the shiny things they find in the game for actual money . Blizzard claims this is to reduce illegitimate items sales and gold farming , in reality , it ' s just another money grab for them . If you want to know why , look no further than the selling fees . You lose 15 % any time you sell and item , and you lose another 15 % every time you try to actually to redeem the money that you ' ve earned . You lose a whopping 30 % on the sale of a digital item . That ' s absolute insanity , and the result is that it drives up prices , making the illegitimate \" black market \" sellers all the more appealing . And of course , there ' s the issue of servers . You ' re forced to play on Blizzard ' s servers , which have had an embarrassingly high amount of downtime thus far . Clearly Blizzard wasn ' t prepared for this . Needless to say , I ' ve found myself rather bored of this game already . There ' s very little incentive to continue playing it aside from the chance to try and make some money on the auction house . There ' s not any significant content on the horizon other than the PvP patch ( which will get old very quickly ) , there ' s no custom user - created content like Starcraft 2 has either ( which isn ' t necessary under normal circumstances , but when there ' s this little content to the game , it absolutely is necessary ) . I will consider my lesson learned for this game , and will eagerly be looking forward to the release of Guild Wars 2 instead . For those lifetime Blizzard fans like me that are still clinging onto hope , know that the Blizzard you once loved is all but dead now . Move on .\n",

      "Example 0: I ' m starting this out with a bold statement . I have been watching reviews and videos on this game since release day . I ' ve checked back every day . But despite hundreds of reviews read and dozens of videos watched : I have not played the game . So WHY do I feel I can review this ? ANSWER : The server issues alone are enough to give the game a 1 star at current time . Some of those issue will improve , some will remain . The game also happens to have issues outside this . Issues agreed on by both sides . I ' ll tackle those too . Server issues : 1 . Servers being crap on launch week = Horrible , but forgivable . Code limitations should have been ironed out in beta , and plenty of hardware should have been provided for launch . Blizzard is NOT a poor indie company that randomly got massive unforseen demand . Still , things happen . 2 . Servers being crap on the following week = WTF . Again Code should have been stress tested and broken during beta . If they didn ' t have enough servers a week gave them plenty of time to set up more . Blizzard has the money , it just didn ' t want to spend it . 3 . Servers still having regular issues over 2 weeks following launch = No words for this . Simply unacceptable for a company of its resources and the amount of development time / metrics they had for this . 4 . Cannot play single player offline . 5 . Server problems further destroy the single player experience . 6 . Great , now people are regularly getting hacked playing single player . Bravo Blizzard . Non - Server Issues : 7 . Character customization has been disintegrated . While this offers a more flexible approach that streamlines and yes simplifies , it nonetheless robs a very important part of the game away from many people . Also , that streamlining and the old issues could have been fixed within the old system easily . This lowers replay . Yes maybe YOU don ' t have an issue with this but people have spoken . An overwhelming amount of people DO have an issue with this , minor or major . 8 . Items . Diablo has always had a strong loot basing as well as being fun to play . Unfortunately the loot distribution and balancing in Diablo 3 is broken atm . Magic items are better than items of higher rarity because they have an inherently much higher dps . Items also appear to be more rare in general by far . This lower also replay . 9 . Auction House , for money . That ' s ok , that ' s what the auction house is for right ? Oh , but ya , you ' re decent items will likely be selling for real world cash now . At least , once it actually works reliably and they add real money . So enjoy your poor itemization unless you want to pay . Because even if you trade 1 : 1 value on the AH you ' ll lose 15 % + listing fee to blizzard . Both sides will : ) . Yay ? 10 . Randomization is very limited : While mobs randomize fairly well maps themselves randomize only minimally . This leads to the same layout and very similar experience on additional runs through an area . This is the 3rd thing that lowers replay . This is further hurt by many reports that the maps are very similar to D2 maps . 11 . Linear . With the game being linear your forced down a cattle chute constantly being hemmed in and guided in only X direction . This inability to freely roam even further limits replay . Combined with the simplified character customization , itemization , and randomization this is a killer that has many people already burning out . People that would not burn out near as easily on this exact same game otherwise . This is further hurt by many reports that the maps are very similar to D2 maps . 12 . Graphics : When most people including most 5 star reviews note that the graphics are last gen , I believe them . This isn ' t as important to me but if graphics being lower than they should be for a game of this calibur bothers you than it ' s a big strike . 13 . Story : I ' m sorry again , most people even 5 star reviews saying the story is forgettable ( if they are kind ) and horrible ( if they are mean ) tells me that the story is simply lack luster . I don ' t expect epicness in this day and age , but cheese factor and mismanagement of prominent characters is a no no . Only certain genres like comic books and comedies can pull that off IF DONE RIGHT . Overview : Lets disregard the server issues as that would automatically fail this game as a consideration for purchase . It ' s assumed these will , eventually ( and apparently with the minimum money investment possible ) be fixed . Regardless it ' s UNFORGIVABLE for a company with the resources of Blizzard and with the testing time / metrics / sales predicitions they had at their disposal . Is this a fun game from everything I know ? Yes . Will it be worth playing after they get server issues lined out ? Yes . Is it a AAA title or worth $ 60 ? HECK NO ! ! This is the level of polish , length , and quality that you should expect from an Indie developer just putting itself on the map and selling the game at $ 15 - $ 20 . This is not the level of game expected of a company the size and notoriety of Blizzard . You ' d be way way better off spending your $ 60 on say , Fallout 1 , 2 , 3 and New Vegas . Torchlight + Titan ' s Quest , and $ 20 left over for whatever you wish . ETC . There are way too many options to justify $ 60 on this game when you can make far far better use of your money elsewhere with far less frustration and likely more and longer fun .\n",

      "Example 0: Played the previous versions and loved them and was not disappointed by this one . I did not get it as soon as it was released as I knew they would have problems right out of the gate , which is also why I bought the actual boxed version , even though most games I buy and download via Steam , Origin and Gameplay . I only had one connection problem in the three or so weeks I ' ve been playing Diablo III . If you were a fan of the previous versions , you should like this one , too .

      "Example 0: Not going to point out all the BS you have to endure in Diablo 3 which makes it completely not worth buying at this time ( give it until late 2012 at least ) , others have already done this enough . I ' m just going to point out my secondary reasons for disliking it : I am a story - oriented player ( I loved Skyrim for instance ) and D3 has little to no real plot . The single - player game is really just there to get you up to speed so you can PVP online vaguely similar to League of Legends . If you like that sort of game you will still not like D3 due to the bugs and connection issues , but when ( presumably later in 2012 ) they get their house in order , the game should be enjoyable for you . For me , D3 fails on all levels : not story - driven , and bugs and connection - issues are so frequent that it reduces the fun in single - player mode , leading to frustration .\n",

      "Example 0: I had some dental surgery last week , so I needed to kill some time at home . Unfortunately , I had played a lot of other games so there was nothing to really try but Diablo 3 . I had heard a lot of tall tales going around about people making big money off the RMAH ( real money auction house ) so I figured why not give it a try . After a week of playing and getting to Inferno act 2 . . . I can safely say this is one of the weirdest products foisted on the gaming community that I ' ve ever seen . I say product , because D3 is more product than game . You surely know how casinos glitz up their slots and their decor to create constant stimulation . . . Well , Diablo 3 is more like a casino than a videogame . The spell effects are big and over the top , the graphics dramatic and colorful . There ' s stimulation constantly . However there ' s no game . Strategy - wise you don ' t really do anything . Either you have the appropriate gear and items to fight or you ' ve run up against a wall and need to buy something extra in the auction house . This can be done with gold you earn playing the game . . . BUT . . . not when it matters . The final run of the game is called Inferno . At this point you ' ll need millions of gold per gear piece by Act 2 or simply die in the game . And remember , as I said there ' s no strategy either way . Either you ' ve bought enough gear , or you die . They were even thoughtful enough to add huge fees for dying in Inferno , to truly lock you in to using the auction house . Now to make matters even worse for the poor soul playing the game normally , they added a real money auction house . Using this brilliant feature you can buy items for up to $ 250 to help you beat a game you already beat 3 times . Make sense ? It shouldn ' t . The \" money for nothing \" greed surrounding this is reminiscent of the web craze called bitcoins . To clarify , everyone loses here except for the house and the early adopters . Because I started the game last week , I doubt I ' ll ever make more than a few dollars here and there on the auction house versus the thousands some have already made . And as the pyramid scheme gets less and less believable by the people willing to hold up the bottom , the whole thing will be utterly worthless . In short , the game currently resembles a money making scheme of the shadiest type more than a game . It really makes me wonder what Blizzard is doing in the gaming business . I mean they are casino developers . That ' s a fact , they just do it in the virtual space . As game developers they lack any concern whatsoever for the elements of the RPG experience . The storytelling is Saturday morning quality , which is being generous . Cartoons usually have themes and some plot development . This game does not ; it just has the silly voice acting of cartoons . This game lacks any attention to gameplay details . It ' s impossible to think of any fresh tactics to try playing this game , because you can ' t do any with the controls and design of it . You can whack away at the monster . You can use one of the few build selections that work at level 60 . That ' s it , the rest is 99 . 9 % stats . Anyone who says all ARPG or dungeon crawlers are this simple is crazy . It ' s the norm for there to be layers of options to your play choices in any game . This game doesn ' t have any layers because they want you to focus on buying the items and that ' s it . So there you go . You have been warned , and probably chastised by many for even thinking about buying this game . But the choice is yours . If you do get it though , give some love to developers of games that care . Check out Guild Wars 2 or some indie games . You can ' t go wrong playing those thoughtfully developed games .\n",

      "Example 0: I ' ll start out saying I didn ' t like D1 or D2 , but enjoy dungeon crawlers such as Dungeon Siege / NWN / Torchlight / Borderlands . So I was reluctant to purchase D3 , and wanted to wait till it was $ 29 bucks or something . Got it anyways on a gift card FTW . The bad : * D3 has to have the worst story line I ' ve ever suffered through . While the voice acting is \" ok \" , what ' s being said is so utterly stupid . It ' s almost like watching some B movie that ' s trying to be serious . I wanted to like this story line . It ' s impossible . Listening to it three times already all I want is some setting that allows me to turn it off . * Always online . Now I ' ve played D3 I understand . Blizzard is greedy and some folks are actually stupid enough to use real money to win this game . Awesome . Thanks for the lag you created designing the game around this greed . * The game is tailored to make you spend gold / money at the AH . At level 40 , the gear dropping for you is 30ish . Anything that drops for you is trash loot compared to what you ' ll buy in the AH for 1000 g . * Loot drops . Why does a wooden stump give me an upgrade when those three elite mobs I fought for 5 minutes dropped trash loot ? * Zone size . You can walk around any \" zone \" in less than 5 minutes once cleared . That means it ' s smaller than my neighborhood . One day maybe we ' ll play a Blizzard game that doesn ' t feel claustrophobic . Highly doubtful - they spend all dev time working on RMAH stuff . * Crafting - Why does a boar drop better gear than I can craft ? Does Blizzard ever get tired of boars ? I ' m really & * # & % $ tired of seeing armored boars in Blizzard games . What do these boars eat to become powerful enough to drop yellow loot ? The good : * It ' s mindless fun . I can ' t stress \" mindless \" enough . There ' s no thinking involved , just click and dodge . Don ' t spend more than 10 seconds analyzing gear , just vendor it and go to the gold AH . Conclusion : Buy it if you like mindless grinds , but don ' t take D3 seriously and certainly don ' t torture yourself with money generating Inferno mode . It ' s maybe a little better than Torchlight 1 , but I don ' t think it ' s a good as Titan Quest . Play the game till it ' s no longer fun , then play something else .\n",

      "Example 0: I ' ve sat through an hour and a half of Diablo III , and honestly , it was boring . Maybe I ' m a bit cynical , but I kind of saw all of this coming , from the first point hearing about the healing orbs ( aka power ups ) to the DRM fiasco . Most if not all the original makers of the Diablo franchise left Blizzard years ago for other companies ( Torchlight / Torchlight 2 ) , leaving a crew that ' s basically made WoW . Unfortunately for them , that ship , WoW , has pretty much run its course . With regards to D3 , the criticism is not really a case of \" this isn ' t Diablo [ II ] enough \" but rather , this is all the bad sides of D2 , with none of the good aspects ( namely character customization and sort of a sandboxey go - where you like when you like feeling . D3 100 % linear guided tour , no choices , game on rails . ) . Take D2 . You had to grind through 2 difficulties before you got to the \" real \" difficulty level where all the good stuff dropped and the tough battles ensued . Doing those quests for a the millionth time really sucked but hey , that ' s what you had to do . And you decided which quests you wanted to do , and sometimes in what order , and could go pretty much wherever you wanted whenever you wanted as long as you killed the act bosses . Only this time , in D3 , you have to grind through 3 difficulties before you get to the final one . At least this time they shortened the time it takes , but in a way that ' s a negative as well just because there is hardly 60 bucks worth of content . In D2 the loot made things interesting , but in D3 the loot is super randomized and always improving but doesn ' t feel special . Think about it . . . would you rather play 60 hours of content on one difficulty level , or play 15 hours of content , four times repeated ? The second option sounds boring , and maybe in my misspent youth I would have gone for it , but now I think gamers know better . Skyrim is looking like A LOT better value right now and at least is a real role - playing game . A roleplaying game is one where you take a risk , you invest in certain skills and skip others , and your character is a unique creation ; you might have picked a good combo , or maybe not , but it was still your choice , your experiment . In Diablo III , it ' s a socialist dystopia where everyone is perfectly equal and perfectly the same and perfectly boring . If you want a character progression and choice over your path , don ' t just walk , run away from this title . Diablo III is a game inspired by RPGs , even the interface and town interiors look ripped from Baldur ' s Gate . But the game itself really has more in common with Contra or Metal Slug , 2d shooter style games where you run around , shoot the baddies , get the power - up , etc etc . The rune system later in the game makes this a little more complex , but is sorta like Contra where you earned different ways of shooting - everyone has access to the exact same runes ( skill tweaks ) at any time , and you can change them at the drop of a hat . Nothing ventured , nothing gained . Diablo III looks like a mishmash of Warcraft III , World of Warcraft , and Diablo . It can ' t quite decide whether it wants to be scary or cute and colorful , so it does both . The monsters and scorched ground areas look ripped from the undead campaigns in Warcraft III . Honestly , if someone had told me this was some sort of super mod for that game , I might have believed them , as the game looks more like I ' d expect a Warcraft game than Diablo . The Grotesque monsters , for example , are supposed to be nasty things that scratch and claw and then blow themselves up into a bloody mess . But instead they look like Kirby from the Nintendo games or mini versions of the Stay Puffed Marshmellow Man from Ghostbusters . Seriously , the monsters are for the most part just WoWish and don ' t look like they belong in a traditional fantasy universe ( like Dungeons and Dragons ) . In the end , I can ' t believe it took them so long to develop what is essentially maybe 15 - 20 hours of content , strung along through repeated difficulties . I ' m sure someone will play this for hundreds of hours trying to get a marginally different styled armor for their cookie cutter character ( since now there are really only as many character builds as there are character types ) . You can take Blizzard ' s side and say that \" streamlining \" the game was good , but in reality , every character is exactly the same looking and acting , minus whatever differences in gear happen . All female wizards for example look EXACTLY alike and have no customization of skills , appearance , face , hair , etc . , etc , and if you ' ve seen one , you ' ve seen them all . This was acceptable in 2000 , not in 2005 and certainly not now . Neverwinter Nights , Guild Wars , and Elder Scrolls games all always offered more depth of who your character was . No replayability . I guess we can face it that this is an action game with customizable armor , but where apparently the physical damage of a held weapon determines your ability to shoot fire and lighting from your palms . I ' m sure someone will say that makes choosing a weapon easier , but it just makes the game make no sense , unless you look at it from the perspective of the developers not having the time or creativity to actually develop a convincing attack bonus system for casters . In a way , the makers are lucky that people are locked out of the game . Everyone wanted more from D3 than they remembered from D2 , and I think most people got much less than they were hoping for . Bad voice acting , bad storyline , and neat but ultimately forgettable cinematics ( probably the cause of all the delay - - Blizzard having to pay for and film the equivalent of a movie within a game ) . A game that can ' t really decide if it ' s a single player game or an MMO , so it tries to do both and doesn ' t truly suceed . This is MMO - light , probably for people who sadly don ' t have the experience to know what this game is missing . If this wasn ' t rentware , I ' d give it 2 stars for at least having town interiors that reminded me of classic Bioware games . I haven ' t said much about the DRM and heavy server lag because everyone already knows the game is going to be somewhat crippled for a little while longer until either more people quit or Blizzard improves capacity . I think it will be a fun game a year or two from now when it is patched and everything is rethought and the price is cut . It is simply unplayable ( lag , disconnects , 40 minutes of lost progress ) at random times , and that ' s why my review is 1 star instead of 2 stars . Until then , save your money , and buy something else . D3 just isn ' t in the same league as the other games mentioned , and it just isn ' t worth paying that much for a temporary game that will be unplayable the day Blizzard decides to pull the plug on their servers , which could be tomorrow or could be 10 years from now ( the mighty can fall - just look at the banks and GM ) . In the end , you aren ' t paying for a game , you ' re paying for a subscription to their ( laggy ) servers , a MMORPG without the RPG and without the MM . Games which are IMO bettersome NWN games ( NWN2 Mask of the Betrayer comes to mind , as do the expansions for the first NWN ) Baldur ' s Gate series ( and anything else made by Bioware with the infinity engine , including Planescape Torment and Icewind Dale ) Dragon Age OriginsGuild Wars seriesElder Scrolls seriesTorchlight series\n",

I am NOT an online gamer anymore but I have all the old Diablo and Warcraft games and I was looking forward to trying Diablo 3 and expansion when the came in the mail . So my internet went out and I thought perfect time to try it out . . . . wrong ! You cant even play single player without being on the web , when my internet came back the next day I installed Diablo 3 and entered the product key , as soon as I went to enter the key for Reaper , the Blizzard server went down and I couldnt ! I tried going to support to do a chat or get a phone call from them , that was a nightmare and all the support links would crash except getting a call . First , you have to fill out a little form ( normal ) , then you have to do these 2 diagnostic things on your computer that they have instructions for , you have to save thew files to your desktop and attach the file on the form , I do all that and click next . . . SERVER DOWN TRY AGAIN LATER ! ! I bought this game , I have the box for both game and expansion and it is pathetic I have to go through this just to play a game by myself on the computer , and it is a shame that I will not even be able to play when I go to the lake home . The game is pretty good but the hassle and internet requirement make it impossible to give this game more than 3 stars even though the first 2 Diablo games were absolute masterpieces and I have been anticipating this game for like . . . 10 years !\n",

      "Example 0: I had fun playing Diablo 3 for awhile but there ' s little reason to replay it again . The first play - through was alright until you realize how repetitive it was . There ' s also a problem with the difficulty scaling I think . On the first play - through the game was almost too easy and then on the next difficulty the game is way too hard . I think part of that has to do with how terrible the loot is . 95 % of the loot you find is worse than the same equipment you found ages ago and 99 % of the loot is for a different class then you ' re playing . I beat Diablo 3 Inferno difficulty and the loot I got after the Diablo boss fight was a joke . I think there was one item for my current class and it ' s stats were way under what I already had from the beginning of the game . If you can pick up Diablo 3 for cheap I ' d buy it but there ' s no reason to pay $ 60 for it . I can see why so many people are disappointed with Diablo 3 after playing it myself .\n",

      "Example 0: The game is extremely fun the first playthrough ( probably 30 hours if you ' re actually watching the movies , etc . ) . The action is fast paced , the skill systems are simplistic in design and interface , but yet very complex since each character has nearly endless possible skill combinations . The game has four difficulties each with increasingly better loot to keep you interested . Normal difficulty is as it should be - not so easy that it ' s boring , but not so hard that anyone is likely to get stuck . Nightmare difficulty is tough , but with persistence and a little bit of thought you ' ll make it through . Hell is Hell , and inferno will be only for the most dedicated and serious players - the top 1 % , if that . The average user is going to start to get stuck around late nightmare / early hell difficulty , and either quit in frustration and give the game a 1 star rating or keep running through dungeons trying to get more gold for that next piece of armor or awesome weapon , to get a bit deeper into the game . So you have a 30 hour plot basically , but replayability is potentially very high .\n",

      "Example 0: After leveling up two level 60 characters , I can say that I have really come to dislike this game . As others have stated , there are huge problems with the loot , drop rates , and the AH and RMAH . It just doesn ' t all work together . The game gets really boring . To level up these 2 characters , I had to run the same story and the same dungeons 3 times for each , just to get to inferno level . I ' m done with this game . NO long term replay value . No longevity . I loved the old diablo games with the loot and the randomized levels . Guess I ' ll have to wait for Torchlight 2 to come out . Update : Despite several major patches , the main problems remain . For a loot based game , the loot sucks . That remains the major problem with D3 . I can understand making the top end loot hard to get , but what is the point of making sub level 60 players go to the auction house to get the best gear . I can count on one hand , the number of useful items I found while leveling up . It just doesn ' t make any sense .\n",

      "Example 0: I loved the earlier games , they were ahead of their time and really pushed not only the RPG genera forward but gaming as a whole . However this watered down garbage is not worth anyone ' s time let alone the obscene 60 $ price tag . The story is basically a badly framed ' last time on Diablo ' recap that fails to engage the player or attempts to actually break new ground . Literally the story is tacked on it feels like an afterthought . The randomly generated dungeons are absent ( short of the possibility to launch ' events ' which are short random fights ) leaving you to slog through the exact same content over and over again . This title really feels half assed . I don ' t know what has been going on the past few years at Bliz but they really have lost their edge . Bottom line , Boring game dont bother .\n",

      "Example 0: I literally have no idea where to start . I am still at such a loss for words for this game , that I am shocked it even exists . I am putting this in 2 parts . The first stage of my disappointment , and the second . First . 1 : The pre - buy crowd that I was in got treated to a lovely heaping pile of incomplete garbage on release day . 2 : The game itself is nothing like it ' s hit predecessors . Skill trees ? No , you just get access to more skills over time . . . No skill points , no decisions . Just tick a box and go to town . 3 : Zero . Support . Ever . 4 : In the first week of release , I had more downtime and lost time due to serverside issues , than actual play time . Bad . So all of these things made me sad , and I uninstalled and Shelved D - 3 till now . . . The winter of my discontent . Second . So I installed it again . What do I get ? Frequent and unreconcilable Hard Crashes . It literally locks my computer up , and my forces restart after about 10 - 13 minutes of play . Consistently and reliably . For reference , I run an Asus G73sw , Win 7 64 bit . It runs every other title in my library flawlessly , including : Farcry 3GTA 4Skyrim ( heavily modded to boot ) XCOM : Enemy UnkownHomefrontS . T . A . L . K . E . R . SeriesSaint ' s Row 4Sid Meier ' s Civilization 5So . Not my computer . It is an interaction between D - 3 and my comp .

      "Example 0: THIS IS A COMMENTARY ON ALL THE 1 - STAR REVIEWS I HAVE READ ON THIS WEB SITEIf you agree with the below , feel free to copy / paste on other sites / boards . Personally , I said \" take a hike , Blizzard \" by not buying Diablo 3 . As a matter of fact , having been burnt by the horrible game of Star Wars : The Old Republic , I did not even buy Mass Effect 3 ( I read gamers ' reviews first and it turns out not buying it was a good decision ) and , most certainly , I will never preorder ANY game ( no matter how much I want to preorder X - COM : Enemy Unknown ) . Over the last 5 years or so , game publishers have repeatedly lied to us , created incredible hype around their products , raised their prices to unbelievable , unprecedented levels and sold us TRASH . . . and WE bought said trash . It is time we all learned our lessons and collectively started doing a few things : - Deliberately ignore all game advertisements as well as all pre - launch statements , comments , promises and previews by game developers or their puppets such as GameSpot ( would GameSpot give D3 a bad preview / review when D3 ads paid by Activision / Blizzard are all over the GS site ? ) ; - Never pre - order anything , ever ; Just don ' t . Ever ; - Never buy ANY game until a couple of months have passed since launch date . Why ? Not only because there may be some foolish , nave , trusting romantics who buy and review it before you but also because if no - one rushes to pay $ 70 - 80 for their ( potentially trash ) games , then in two months ' time the price ( in view of low demand ) will have to drop to more reasonable levels of $ 40 - 50 or even less . If we do this enough game publishers will have to change their unethical practices . Video gaming ( and especially computer gaming as opposed to console gaming ) used to be a true art form and the games stimulated your mind and spirit . The games of the last half decade have grown increasingly dumbed - down , streamlined , simplified , trivialized ; they have turned into mainstream Hollywood assembly line of mass - produced garbage . Most of these games stimulate nothing but your mousing or button - mashing fingers and in the process insult your intelligence . It is time to say to game publishers : - We want OUR gaming back ; - You will not tell us what ' s good and force it down our throats until we like it ; - We will buy what we want and we refuse to buy what we DON ' T want no matter how much YOU think we should like it ; It is time the gaming community stood up to the tyranny of Activisions , EAs and the like . If you agree with the above , feel free to copy / paste on other sites / boards .\n",

      "Example 0: This game really suffers due to Activision / Blizzards interest in massive profits from this sequel three years in the making . I ' ve played for ~ 50 hours or so across three characters ( level 52 Barbarian , level 35 Wizard and level 29 Demon Hunter ) and the higher the level of the character , the less likely it is you ' ll get a drop that is an upgrade for your character . This is on purpose as Activision / Blizzard ' s goal is to drive people to their real money auction house so they can progress in the game . Now I ' m expected to either pay additional $ $ $ for this $ 60 game to allow my character ' s progress , or simply quit playing . This is not an improvement over Diablo II , it ' s an obvious money - grab and Blizzard should be ashamed . I expect this type of thing from Activision , but not Blizzard .\n",

      "Example 0: This game is an absolute failure . The game is still currently , \" unless I have time to play 8 hours a day or buy a bot ( automated program that plays the game for you ) , I have to pay real money to buy items from people who do play 8 hours a day or use bots all day . \" The game is still 0 fun . They ' ve added absolutely nothing new . The way this game is right now , should be what a game looks like in the alpha . Item design is still terrible . Random stats on all items in the game ? Two handed swords that only give intelligence ?

      "Example 0: Diablo III is not a game . It is merely an access kit to a game , which is stored somewhere on Blizzard ' s server farms . To play the game , you must have and maintain a highspeed internet connection . Everything in \" your game \" - - your data , your gear , your characters - - is actually Blizzard ' s , parked on one of their servers . While the rationale for doing this varies and includes everything from stopping piracy to blocking mods / hacking and making money off the \" auction house \" , the outcome is the same : you don ' t own this game or even any substantial part of it . All you own is a key that lets you in to visit the game , so long as Blizzard feels like keeping its servers up and maintaining \" your \" characters and data during your prescribed visiting hours . As many have already discovered , they don ' t feel like doing that particularly well . This situation has been a long time coming . Years ago , in what is now obviously a faded golden age of gaming , you actually owned the game you bought . Subject to at most perhaps an annoying CD security key , you still at least had a physical object that you could carry around and load into other physical objects whenever you felt like , enjoying the game for as many years as you want and anywhere you want without requiring pre - approval from the company ' s massive cloud computing Death Star . Somehow , us gamers let that time get away from us . Starcraft II was the most recent warning , when people discovered that much of the functionality of Starcraft had actually disappeared and live internet was required even for single player campaigns ( which also were initially missing 2 of the 3 playable races included in Starcraft 1 by default ) . People got upset , but not upset enough to make a difference . Perhaps things have changed now . The simple fact is that we are going backwards in game design even as technology improves . Diablo III is a pathetic shell compared to Diablo II . Like a divorced parent , you have to count the moments until you can visit your characters for a little while , and then get kicked back out the door the moment your visitation window ends . Whether the series will continue to devolve into nothing more than a series of lame DLCs hidden on Blizzard servers and locked by $ 60 - 100 paygates depends as much on us as it does on them .\n",
